This is urgent. This is about delivering basic services. This is a public health issue. The solution is self-evident: Immediate supplementation must be provided with a focus on the missed routes.\u201d  \nThe call for action is part of the Council\u2019s ongoing push to get waste management on track in New Orleans.\nAlthough overshadowed by the controversy surrounding Metro Services' trash collection woes, Richard's record has also been inadequate for much of the last year and a half following Hurricane Ida.  \n\u201cThe lack of basic trash and recycling pickup service is unacceptable,\u201d District B's Harris said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the City to get to the bottom of this issue. The Department of Sanitation must announce a plan to stabilize trash collection across Service Area 2.\u201d \nFor months, residents in the service area \u2014 which encompasses large swaths of Uptown, Mid-City, Broadmoor, Gentilly, Ninth Ward and Algiers, have been in distress over the city\u2019s failure to provide this basic municipal service. \n\u201cWe are still seeing a high volume of calls about missed trash and recycling collections in District C on both sides of the river,\u201d said King. \u201cThis issue does not seem to be improving.\"  \nAs Carnival season kicks off, the council members emphasized the need for swift action as the city\u2019s population is expected to swell with tourists and celebrations in the coming weeks.  \nHarris, who chairs the council\u2019s Quality of Life Committee, said, \u201cit should not be the responsibility of residents to constantly report missed pickups.\"  \nCantrell's administration also acknowledged the problem Friday afternoon and issued a statement, saying they were confident that they will find a solution. \"The City of New Orleans is aware of Richard's failure to live up to the demands of its contract,\" a spokesperson said. \"The administration has been working toward a solution that will ensure the residents will receive the sanitations they pay for and that they deserve.\"  \nThis story has been updated with a statement from the Cantrell administration.  \nBECOME A GAMBIT MEMBER AND JOIN OUR KREWE TODAY\nFor more than 40 years, Gambit has covered New Orleans, for New Orleans.
