A new debate begins\nBY MATT SLEDGE | Staff writer\nApr 4, 2023\n3 min to read\n1 of 2\nPeople who live on the streets are fed a hot meal in New Orleans, Sunday, Dec. 25, 2022.\nSTAFF PHOTO BY DAVID GRUNFELD\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nPrint\nCopy article link\nSave\nSolutions for crime and homelessness would claim tens of millions of the city\u2019s remaining federal relief dollars under a plan unveiled by Mayor LaToya Cantrell's administration on Tuesday, while progressive groups made a much larger pitch that would also call for the use of money from the general fund.\nIn the city\u2019s vision, the New Orleans Health Department would quarterback programs designed to prevent violence, such as mental health services for school children and a rejuvenated street team of violence \u201cinterrupters.\u201d\nAlong with a $10 million plan targeting homelessness, the plan would use $38.4 million of the remaining $53.6 million in pandemic relief funds from the American Rescue Plan Act.\nA coalition of progressive groups, by contrast, told the City Council that the city\u2019s one-time spending should rise much higher. They proposed a $147 million package, including $107 million for housing, that would also draw from a growing pot of unspent general fund dollars.\nThe council members who will have the final say sounded receptive notes but didn\u2019t make firm commitments. Next week, they will hear from the city\u2019s chief administrative officer, Gilbert Monta\u00f1o, who prefers keeping more money socked away.\nThe debate that will play out in the coming weeks is in many ways a repeat of the 2023 budget process, which culminated in a last-minute, $262 million amendment to use one-time funds. Advocates said they were caught off guard in December, and this time around, they\u2019re keen to make their voices heard.\n\u201cNow the question is, how do you reconcile what the city wants to do with the (relief) money with what we heard today from advocacy groups and from people interested in how that money is spent?\u201d said City Council member Joe Giarrusso, who chairs the budget committee.\nCity plan\nThe late-breaking budget amendment last year aimed lots of one-time money at the most urgent issue for many voters -- violent crime. Big spends included $22.5 million for police recruitment and retention, $30 million for new criminal justice software and $4.9 million for juvenile probation and parole.\nBut some advocates complained that far too many of those funds were directed at punitive measures instead of social services. The Cantrell administration is now proposing a package aimed at preventing and interrupting violence through non-policing measures.\nThe city\u2019s plan includes $10 million for a joint program between NOLA Public Schools and Children\u2019s Hospital to place mental health professionals, case managers and expanded services in the \u201chighest risk\u201d schools where kids need help to address trauma. Separately, the school system would partner with the city's Office of Workforce Development for an $8.1 million program to put at-risk high schoolers on career paths.\nMayor LaToya Cantrell and Dr. Jennifer Avegno, pictured in 2020 \nPHOTO BY MAX BECHERER / THE TIMES-PICAYUNE/NEW ORLEANS ADVOCATE\nOther expenditures would include $500,000 for a rebooted violence interruption street team, $1 million for a blight remediation partnership between Tulane public health researchers and city code enforcement, $2.5 million for pocket parks, $5 million for financial assistance programs and $1 million for food security programs.\nThe city\u2019s package is designed to put a \u201cdown payment\u201d on projects that have been proven to reduce crime, said Dr. Jennifer Avegno, health department director. The City Council in January passed a motion mandating that her department create a violence reduction program.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t make significant investments in the root causes of crime and violence \u2013 and certainly, from the public health perspective, shootings and killings, which are a major cause of mortality in this city \u2013 then you\u2019re not getting a lot for your money,\u201d she said.\nSeparately, the city would spend $10 million on reducing homelessness.\nThe city\u2019s proposals draw only from American Rescue Plan Act funds. However, advocates note that the city also has a growing pot of unspent general fund dollars \u2013 pegged at $274 million in a recent city report.\nCAO Gilbert Montano, right \nPHOTO BY BRETT DUKE / THE TIMES-PICAYUNE\nMonta\u00f1o said that number represents an unaudited point-in-time figure. He acknowledged that the city\u2019s fund balance is \u201csizable\u201d but said he wants to keep a healthy reserve in place for emergencies and economic downturns.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t protect the city for the future, then I don't think we\u2019re being good stewards,\u201d he said.\nAdvocates\u2019 plan\nThe community groups pitching the council on Tuesday proposed a much more aggressive spending plan. They said it would be a mistake to continue using the federal pandemic relief dollars to build up the city\u2019s fund balance.\nPresenters from the Louisiana Fair Housing Action Center, New Orleans Workers Center for Racial Justice and the Vera Institute said they had contacted dozens of community groups for input and conducted their own vetting project to come up with a wish-list of mostly existing projects that could benefit from infusions of one-time cash.\nThe top item on that list was $107 million for housing, including $70 million for the construction of affordable rental housing, $15 million for reducing street homelessness and $10 million for the renovation of existing but substandard rental units.\nOther proposals include a $20 million investment in youth development through community organizations and $18 million for \"community equity\" projects including $5 million for free public transit fares, $5 million for food banks and food producers, and $5.2 million in direct cash assistance for people who were left out of earlier rounds of government assistance during the pandemic.\nWill Snowden, director of Vera Institute of Justice's New Orleans office\nPROVIDED PHOTO\nWhile last year\u2019s budget appropriated tens of millions to agencies that respond to crime, Will Snowden, the director of the Vera Institute in New Orleans, said it was time to pivot to addressing root causes. He saw the groups\u2019 proposal as a floor, rather than a ceiling.\n\u201cThere can be more. When we\u2019re having conversations in New Orleans about what provides public safety and what creates public safety, it is these kinds of investments,\u201d he said.\nEmail Matt Sledge at msledge@theadvocate.com.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nPrint\nCopy article link\nSave\nCity ARPA plan\nCity of New Orleans Apr 5, 2023\nMORE INFORMATION\nThe Nightly Top 5: Catch up on today's top stories\nDebate continues over how New Orleans should spend millions in pandemic relief aid, S&WB walks back its threat to cut water to tenants wit\u2026\nTags\nHardwall\nThis Day in History\nSponsored by Connatix\nRecommended for you\nRecommended by\nSECTIONS\nHOME\nNEWS\nOPINION\nSPORTS\nENTERTAINMENT/LIFE\nNEWSLETTERS\nGAMES\nSERVICES\nCLASSIFIEDS\nSEARCH\nSUBSCRIBE | GROUPS\nDIGITAL ADVERTISING\nHELP/CONTACT US\nRSS FEEDS\nMEDIA KIT\nEEDITION\nCAREERS\nTEACHER'S LINK\nREVIEWING THE RECORD\nOUR SITES\nOBITUARIES\nJOBS\nCELEBRATIONS\nNIE\nCLASSIFIEDS\nHOMES\nPETS\nARCHIVES\nSTORE\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nnola.com\n840 St. Charles Avenue\nNew Orleans, LA 70130\nPhone: 504-529-0522\n\nNews Tips:\nnolanewstips@theadvocate.com\nOther questions:\nsubscriberservices@theadvocate.com\nNeed help?\nReport a delivery issue\nCreate a temporary stop\nSign up for recurring payments\nPay your bill\nUpdate your billing info\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2023 NOLA.com 840 St. Charles Avenue, New Orleans, LA  | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy\nPowered by BLOX Content Management System from BLOX Digital.\n  This website stores data such as cookies to enable essential website functionality, marketing, personalization and analytics.
