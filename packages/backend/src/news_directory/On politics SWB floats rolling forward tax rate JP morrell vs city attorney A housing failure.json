At the board\u2019s Sept. 20 meeting, he said that he will argue for a roll forward, as the S&WB is in full tree-shaking mode to pay for a critical drainage power upgrade and a citywide meter replacement project.\nKorban seemed to recognize the odds are against him since the council has final say over the S&WB\u2019s millage rates.\n\u201cThe city council could reject our request, but I feel strongly that we need to make that request,\u201d Korban said.\nKorban\u2019s position could create an awkward situation for Cantrell, the board\u2019s chairperson, who, along with other board members, would vote on the roll forward before sending the request to the council.\nCantrell, while not addressing the S&WB specifically, has been unambiguously opposed to increasing tax burdens on homeowners who have seen astronomical insurance increases since Hurricane Ida.\n\u201cI don't believe that the time is now to roll forward,\u201d Cantrell said at a community meeting in Gentilly on July 25. \u201cThis is something that we can continue to discuss. But I will say right now, I'm not changing relative to the roll forward.\u201d\nState law automatically \u201crolls back\u201d tax rates when property assessments increase, but taxing bodies then have the option to restore existing rates to reap the additional revenue.\nIn addition to the S&WB, the City Council approves property taxes for a range of services, including public safety, libraries, parks and recreation and early childhood education. The S&WB drainage taxes bring in about $81 million annually under current rates.\nThe roll forward would bring in an additional $11 million annually for the S&WB, costing the owner of a $350,000 home an extra $89.76 per year, after factoring in a homestead exemption.\nDonald Trump's lawyer? \nTensions between the City Council and City Attorney\u2019s Office surfaced again this week, with Council President JP Morrell passing a measure to require his signature on legal contracts and telling City Attorney Donesia Turner she is \u201clike a Donald Trump lawyer.\u201d\nThat last zinger, from the Democratic council member to the appointee of a Democratic mayor, came during a council hearing to consider removing Mayor LaToya Cantrell\u2019s communications director, Gregory Joseph, over his role in sending a glossy mailer promoting Cantrell to likely voters.\nA Morrell-led council investigation concluded the flier was illegally financed with city funds, since it arrived at the height of the failed recall campaign targeting the mayor. \nThe council is now considering removing Joseph under a rarely (if ever) used city charter provision giving the council authority to remove unclassified officials for gross misconduct and other offenses. A vote on Joseph\u2019s removal was scheduled for Tuesday, but he didn\u2019t show up. \nInstead, it was Turner who appeared and requested a two-week continuance to allow Joseph to find a lawyer. That irked Morrell, who protested that Turner was already representing Joseph by appearing in council chambers on his behalf. \nMorrell was also unhappy with Joseph\u2019s public comments, including a social media post shortly before the hearing on Tuesday, that Morrell said made a mockery of the proceedings. \n\u201cThis is Donald Trump levels of insane, as you're sitting here saying he takes the process seriously,\u201d Morrell said.\nWhen Turner said she doesn\u2019t follow Joseph\u2019s social media, Morrell retorted that \u201cyou sound like a Donald Trump lawyer.\u201d\nNew Orleans City Council member JP Morrell.\nSTAFF FILE PHOTO BY CHRIS GRANGER\n\u201cI am not a Donald Trump lawyer. Maybe Donald Trump has very good lawyers, as I am one,\u201d Turner replied. \u201cBut I cannot explain a post that Mr. Joseph posted and I have not seen.\u201d\nThat exchange followed the council\u2019s vote last month to freeze $6.7 million from the City Attorney\u2019s Office budget, a move aimed at stalling outside legal contracts. Council members said the administration had cut them out of the loop on legal strategies in various matters, and the goal was to force better cooperation. The budget freeze remained in effect as of this week.\nMorrell on Thursday took it another step, passing a measure to require the council president\u2019s signature on all legal contracts in the future. \n\u201cWe tend to find out well after the fact when legal services have been engaged on the city\u2019s behalf, representing both the administration and the council, and this simply inserts us in the hiring process,\u201d Morrell said before the vote.\nNew Orleans flunks housing \u2014 again \nNew Orleans got another failing grade for its lackluster effort to provide affordable housing, according to HousingNOLA\u2019s annual report card for the city.\nThe last time the city got a passing grade was in 2019, when the advocacy group awarded a D.  \n\u201cThere\u2019s no way around the fact that the powers that be in the City of New Orleans, and the state as a whole, would rather put on sideshows than address one of the greatest crises we face,\u201d the report begins.\nThe city has fallen short on expanding affordable housing supply, enforcing fair housing policy and encouraging sustainable design, the report argues. \nAndreanecia Morris with Housing NOLA at her office on Tuesday, October 11, 2022.

And just 102 units were added to the city's housing supply between September 2022 and August 2023 \u2014 a drop in the bucket of what is needed. \n\u201cIf we do not address these problems, New Orleans is facing a mass level displacement event,\u201d said Andreanecia Morris, director of HousingNOLA at a press conference about the report on Thursday.\nThe mayor\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment about HousingNOLA\u2019s report\nEmail Ben Myers at bmyers@theadvocate.com.
