Here at home, the New Orleans city council is making moves to fix that issue. At a council meeting at the end of May, the council allocated a $32 million for a gap fun to support affordable housing development.\nDistrict B Council Member Lesli Harris said, \"I'm very excited about it.\"\nThat fund largely supported by the American Rescue Plan Act, is called the Affordable Workforce Housing Gap Financing Fund. The money will act as a gap or buffer funding for developers who are actively working on affordable housing projects across the city.\nHarris said, \"These are 14 existing projects that are in the pipeline that have experienced shortages because of construction coast, insurance costs.\"\nHer goal now is to secure some sort of long-term funding for the fund so a long-term investment in affordable housing is secured.\n\"I think that in the future, we need to be looking at other sources of funding so that we have an evergreen pot of money that can assist with gap funding,\" Harris said.\nHowever, some housing advocates feel something needs to be done to help residents today, not years down the line.\nAndreanecia Morris, the Executive Director of Housing NOLA said, \"They are missing too many opportunities to put the people of New Orleans first.\"\nWhile Morris applauds the gap fund, she said the city is looking far ahead and not looking at what can be done today to ease the housing crisis. Morris said the most recent example of this this the council's failure to move the Healthy Homes Ordnance forward at a recent council meeting.\n\"They take a step forward, while simultaneously taking several steps back,\" Morris said. \"Before they voted to delay it, they actually gutted it. So that was something that would set the standard, set accountability standards for most of the people who live in New Orleans, but they decided not to do this. They decided not to do this in a meaningful and impactful way. We need policy, that means our leaders taking demonstrable ineffective action.\"\nOne suggestion according to Morris would be city support for local landlords and property owners. She believes this could help get 20% of the homes currently vacant in the city get back up and running.\nEscape the T-Mobile Price Hike: How to Opt Out of Expensive Plans!

I want to highlight that today's meeting represented a big win for affordable housing in New Orleans.  The council approved a contract to retain a national expert on addressing homelessness, installed a temporary ban on new commercial STRs, passed a motion to incentivize affordable homeownership development, and introduced anti-retaliation legislation that protects renters who report code violations.\"\nHarris said the council is looking at multi layered solutions from every angle.\n\"We're looking at blighted properties, coming up with solutions to stop chronic homelessness, all of this is a very holistic thing that we really need to address but this council is really committed to the creation of more affordable housing,\" said Harris.\nRelated Articles\nJefferson Parish says it is trying to help homeless get off the street\nJefferson Parish, NOLA homelessness crisis intensifying post-pandemic\nCVS Hates When You Get 87\u00a2 ED Meds, But They Can\u2019t Stop You\nPublic Health Forum by Friday Plans\n|\nSponsored\nLouisiana Seniors Are Getting 250k Insurance For As Little as $12/month (See Prices)\nLife Insurance\n|\nSponsored\n21 Gutter Guards Put to the Test: See What Roofers Found\nThe Actual Cost of Gutter Guards In 2023 May Surprise You\nLeafFilter Partner\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nHere Is The Average Cost Of Veterinarians In Metairie\nBadlands Ranch\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nWhy Rob Gronkowski Chooses These Hybrid Shoes\nShoes Much More Comfortable Than Traditional Dress Shoes.
