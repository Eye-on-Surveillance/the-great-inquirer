Read our privacy notice\nAfter the New Orleans City Council voted to allow the use of facial recognition software to identify criminals more readily and accurately, reports indicate that the technology was ineffective and erroneous.\nThis system went into effect in the summer of 2022, and Politico obtained records of the year\u2019s worth of results. The outlet found that not only was the facial recognition tool vastly incapable of identifying suspects, but it was also disproportionately used on Black people.\nAnd from October 2022 to August 2023, almost every facial recognition request regarded a Black suspect.\nPolitico reported that in total, the department made 19 requests. However, two of them were thrown out because police had identified the suspect before the system\u2019s results came back, while two others were rejected because the program\u2019s application didn\u2019t extend to those crimes.\nSo, of the 15 requests made by the New Orleans Police Department, 14 concerned Black suspects, the outlet wrote. On top of this, only six of these requests turned up with matches \u2014 and half of those were erroneous \u2014 while the remaining nine did not pull up a match.\nFacial recognition technology has long been controversial. The city of New Orleans previously had banned the use of facial recognition software, which went into effect in 2020 following the death of George Floyd. Then, in 2022, the city reversed course, allowing it to be used.\nIn the wake of the reversal, the ACLU of Louisiana Advocacy Director Chris Kaiser called the new ordinance \u201cdeeply flawed.\u201d He not only pointed out research that indicated that \u201cracial and gender bias\u201d affected the program\u2019s accuracy but also highlighted privacy concerns around the data that the program relies on when identifying potential suspects.\nA previous investigation by The Independent revealed that at least six people around the US have been falsely arrested using facial ID technology; all of them are Black. One such arrest occurred in Louisiana, where the use of facial recognition technology led to the wrongful arrest of a Georgia man for a string of purse thefts.\nRegardless of the false arrests, at least half of federal law enforcement agencies with officers and a quarter of state and local agencies are using it.\nAt least one council member acknowledged the shortcomings of this technology. \u201cThis department hung their hat on this,\u201d New Orleans Councilmember At-Large JP Morrell told Politico. Mr Morrell voted against using facial recognition last year. After seeing the police department\u2019s data and usage, he said the tool is \u201cwholly ineffective and pretty obviously racist.\u201d\n\u201cThe data has pretty much proven that advocates were mostly correct,\u201d Mr Morell continued. \u201cIt\u2019s primarily targeted towards African Americans and it doesn\u2019t actually lead to many, if any, arrests.\u201d\nCity councillor Eugene Green, who introduced the measure to lift the ban, holds a different view. He told Politico that he still supports the agency\u2019s use of facial recognition. \u201cIf we have it for 10 years and it only solves one crime, but there\u2019s no abuse, then that\u2019s a victory for the citizens of New Orleans.\u201d\nIt is important to note that despite hiccups with the system\u2019s results, the agency\u2019s use has led to any known false arrests.\n\u201cWe needed to have significant accountability on this controversial technology,\u201d council member Helena Moreno, who co-authored the initial ban, told the outlet.\nNew Orleans has a system in place in which the police department is required to provide details of how the tool was used to the City Council on a monthly basis; although Politico disclosed that the department agreed with the council that it could share the data quarterly.\nWhen asking about the potential flaws with the facial recognition tool, as outlined by Politico\u2019s reporting, a New Orleans Police Department spokesperson told The Independent that \u201crace and ethnicity are not a determining factor for which images and crimes are suitable for Facial Recognition review. However, a description of the perpetrator, including race, is a logical part of any search for a suspect and is always a criterion in any investigation.\u201d\nThe department spokesperson also emphasised that its investigators do not rely solely on facial recognition, \u201cbut it is one of multiple tools that can be used to aid in investigations,\u201d like evidence and/or forensics, adding that officers are trained to conduct \u201cbias-free investigations.\u201d\n\u201cThe lack of arrests in which Facial Recognition Technology was used as a tool, is evidence that NOPD investigators are being thorough in their investigations,\u201d the statement concluded.\nMore aboutNew OrleansPoliceAIFacial Recognition\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments\nGET IN TOUCH\nContact us\nOUR PRODUCTS\nSubscribe\nRegister\nNewsletters\nDonate\nToday\u2019s Edition\nInstall our app\nArchive\nOTHER PUBLICATIONS\nInternational editions\nIndependent en Espa\u00f1ol\nIndependent Arabia\nIndependent Turkish\nIndependent Persian\nIndependent Urdu\nEvening Standard\nEXTRAS\nAdvisor\nPuzzles\nAll topics\nBetting\nVoucher codes\nCompetitions and offers\nIndependent Advertising\nIndependent Ignite\nSyndication\nWorking at The Independent\nLEGAL\nCode of conduct and complaints\nContributors\nCookie policy\nDonations Terms & Conditions\nPrivacy notice\nUser policies\nModern Slavery Act",
