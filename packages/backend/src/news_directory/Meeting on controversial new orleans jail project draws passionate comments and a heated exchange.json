The new jail wing features a controversial design known as a panopticon, where cells are arranged in a large circle surrounding a central \u201ccommand center\u201d in the middle. It\u2019s an architectural concept that dates back to the 1780s that one prison expert described as \u201cchaotic, inhumane, ineffective, overwhelming.\u201d\nOrleans Sheriff Susan Hutson does not support the new facility, either. Phase III was introduced by her predecessor, Marlin Gusman, and approved by former Mayor Mitch Landrieu\u2019s administration. Hutson has written a letter to Federal Magistrate Judge Michael North urging the court to reconsider its support for the project.\nNew Orleans jail expansion sees more opposition during public planning commission meeting\n\u201cToday we\u2019re trying to make democracy work,\u201d Reilly said outside of city hall. \u201cThe people of this city have voted with their feet to not expand the jail into Phase III. And that was done when Susan Hutson overwhelmingly defeated Marlon Gusman, who supported Phase III.\u201d\nVOTE\u2019s press conference took place ahead of a scheduled City Council meeting where the project\u2019s cost and alternatives to it would be discussed. The group was in attendance to make public comments to try to convince the council to stand against the project.\n\u201cWe're going to have our voices heard,\u201d Reilly said to the crowd just before the meeting. \u201cWe hope that the city council is with us. They've been with us before and we see no reason why we can't walk out of this thing with this jail dead.\u201d\nDrew Hawkins\n/\nGulf States Newsroom\nVOTE members sit in New Orleans City Council chambers on Wednesday, July 12, 2023. The grassroots organization founded and run by formerly incarcerated people attended the meeting to make public comments during an assessment of the controversial Phase III project at the Orleans Justice Center.\nInside city hall, conversations grew more heated. Prison-expansion opponents \u2014 like VOTE \u2014 have previously suggested that the only people supporting the project are contractors who could make money off of building it. They\u2019ve also questioned the motives of any city official who supports the project.\nAs City Councilmember JP Morrell was on his way into the council chambers, Reilly spotted him and briefly spoke to him. The conversation took a turn, ending with Morrell telling Reilly that implying any level of corruption is uncalled for in an expletive-laden outburst.\n\u201cIntimating corruption when you have no evidence is very upsetting,\u201d Morrell said to Reilly. \u201cWe can disagree on issues, but sometimes you just say s\u2014 that\u2019s just out of bounds, and I don\u2019t appreciate it.\u201d\nMorrell then emphasized that he didn\u2019t have \u201cany conversations with any f\u2014--- contractors\u201d before entering the chambers and taking his seat.\nNew Orleans City Councilmember JP Morrell\nOut in the hall following Morrell\u2019s outburst, Reilly said he never meant to imply that a specific councilperson was corrupt and he doesn\u2019t have any hard feelings toward Morrell for the interaction.\n\u201cI think it's understandable that if someone even made a hint that I might be corrupt, I would take offense to that, so I don't hold anything against the councilman,\u201d Reilly said, referring to Morrell. \u201cI mean, the thing is, if we're not pushing on each other, what are we doing here?\u201d\nEvery speaker during the public comment portion of the meeting opposed the Phase III project.\n\u201cJail is bad for people, no matter whether it\u2019s Phase III or what you do, jail is a bad place to be,\u201d said Meghan Garvey, policy counsel for the Orleans Public Defenders Office. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for people, and there\u2019s nothing you can do with money, with buildings, or anything that changes that.\u201d\nGarvey said the Phase III facility represents a \u201ccommitment to failure\u201d because the jail population has been decreasing in recent years but is now \u201ccreeping back up.\u201d\n\u201cWe have a problem with too many people who are severely mentally ill in this jail and no matter what you build, it\u2019s not going to change that,\u201d Garvey said. \u201cThe jail is never going to be an OK place to take care of people that are that sick.\u201d\nEvery council member present, including Morrell, made clear that they do not support the Phase III expansion, each expressing that the money for the facility could be better spent on mental health resources for incarcerated people. The City Council has already called for an audit of the costs associated with the project.\nCouncilmember Oliver Thomas expressed his disapproval in colorful terms.\n\u201cSometimes my colleagues will tease me about when I wasn\u2019t around and what they used to do,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cBut let me say this: this is the goofiest thing I have seen in my entire political life. I\u2019ve never seen something so outrageous \u2014 that we would be willing spend money that we don\u2019t have to do something that will not work.\u201d\nThis story was produced by the Gulf States Newsroom, a collaboration between Mississippi Public Broadcasting, WBHM in Alabama, WWNO and WRKF in Louisiana and NPR. \nTags\nNews Louisiana NewsGulf States NewsroomOrleans Justice Centercriminal justice reform\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\nDrew Hawkins\nDrew Hawkins is the health equity reporter for the Gulf States Newsroom.
