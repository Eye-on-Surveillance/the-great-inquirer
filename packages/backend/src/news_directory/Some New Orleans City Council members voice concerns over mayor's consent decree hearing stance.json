Morrell, Vice President Helena Moreno, Joseph I. Giarrusso and Leslie Harris issued a letter to several judges voicing their concerns over the mayor's actions.\nThe letter says the fighting is a \"direct attack on democratic values,\" and \"a waste of resources.\nThey asked for a \"greater collaboration\" between the courts and the city to avoid unnecessary fees.\nRecommended\nVoter registation deadlines for October elections\nThe letter goes on to say that although the council could not control the mayor, they would consider how public funding is used if the problem surrounding attendance at the meetings persists.\nThe next public consent decree hearing is scheduled for April 12.\nTOP PICKS\nAmazon Prime Big Deal Days 2023: The best deals we're seeing for October Prime Day event\nRossen Reports: 5 things in your house you didn\u2019t know expire\nA mom shielding her son from gunmen and a 'pro-peace' academic are among the Americans killed in Israel\nWhat is Hamas?\nWDSU NEW ORLEANS\nContact Us\nNews Team\nApps & Social\nEmail Alerts\nCareers\nInternships\nAdvertise\nDigital Advertising Terms & Conditions\nBroadcast Terms & Conditions\nRSS\nEEO Reports\nCaptioning Contacts\nPublic Inspection File\nPublic File Assistance\nFCC Applications\nNews Policy Statements\nHearst Television participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites.\n\u00a92023, Hearst Television Inc. on behalf of WDSU-TV.\nPrivacy Notice\nYour California Privacy Rights\nInterest-Based Ads\nTerms of Use\nSite Map",
