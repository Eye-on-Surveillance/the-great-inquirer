Their presentation is part of the public process this spring to figure out how to use those one-time funds, including what\u2019s left of the $388 million in ARPA money received by the city \u2014 most of which remains virtually untouched.\nThe plan is a chance for local leaders to align city funding with their stated values, especially when it comes to affordable housing, said Maxwell Ciardullo with the Louisiana Fair Housing Action Center.\nThe advocates say the $15 million they want the city to direct toward homelessness reduction initiatives would house the more than 400 people currently believed to be living on the streets. The plan would also direct $70 million for new development that could generate up to 2,000 additional permanently affordable units across low-poverty and gentrifying neighborhoods, along with $20 million toward forgivable loans for small landlords and low-income homeowners to repair health and safety violations and $2 million in one-time funds to support renters displaced by health and safety violations.\nNew Orleans is falling behind its peers, given that other cities across the South have already doled out dollars for affordable housing, Ciardullo said. Closer to home, Baton Rouge, which received $165 million in COVID-19 aid, has allocated spending toward gun violence reduction strategies, a modest number of planned affordable housing units, neighborhood revitalization and youth employment programs.\nCouncilmembers dug into specifics of some of the proposals. How would the city ensure that so-called \u201cslumlords\u201d wouldn\u2019t take advantage of a rental repair program for small landlords, Councilmember Lesli Harris asked. Could making city buses free help with the \u201cfraught\u201d busing situation for New Orleans charter school students, as Councilmember JP Morrell put it.\nCouncilmember Joe Giarrusso raised another potential use for the money not mentioned in the advocates\u2019 proposal: mortgage assistance for first-time homebuyers. \u201cThat\u2019s another piece we\u2019ve got to be looking at,\u201d Giarrusso said.\nTravis Hills, who lives at the homeless shelter on Gravier Street, gave a public comment to councilmembers following the presentation: \u201cFrom everything I hear, it sounds good,\u201d Hill said. \u201cJust show me the money.\u201d\nThe city has until the end of 2024 to decide how to use its leftover pandemic aid and the end of 2026 to actually spend it. The city technically used nearly all of its first round of ARPA dollars, totalling $194 million, to shore up departments amid anticipated revenue shortfalls in 2021 and 2022. However, due to higher-than-expected tax revenues and lower-than-expected expenses, it was able to save about the same amount and put the money in its reserve fund, which had grown to about $300 million by the beginning of this year. Of the second $194 million ARPA round, about $100 million has yet to be allocated.\nThe U.S. Treasury, which administers the funds, has encouraged local and state governments to spend the money on affordable housing, though governments can use their ARPA funds across four categories: replacing lost revenue, responding to public health and other pandemic impacts, offering premium pay for essential workers, and bulking up water, ewer and broadband infrastructure.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the groups\u2019 suggested spending plan for New Orleans:\nHousing: $70 million to build new affordable housing units, with another $37 million directed toward homelessness reduction initiatives ($15 million), forgivable loans for small landlords and low-income homeowners to repair health and safety violations ($20 million) and one-time funds to support renters displaced by health and safety violations ($2 million).\nYouth development: $20 million to support the Children Youth and Planning Board and fund programs for opportunity youth.\nCommunity violence prevention: $2 million to bolster the budget of the Office of Gun Violence Prevention.\nCommunity equity: $18 million across initiatives including a pilot program to make public transit free for riders ($5 million), cash assistance for some essential workers ($5.2 million) aiding food banks and expanding access to food assistance ($5 million), expanding the Office of Resilience and Sustainability ($2 million), an audit of contractor and subcontractors to ensure compliance with city labor laws ($500,000) and translation services for assorted city materials and City Council hearings ($500,000).\nThis article first appeared on Verite and is republished here under a Creative Commons license.\nTags\nNews City of New OrleansNew Orleans City Councilcity hallCOVID-19affordable housingpublic transportationyouth\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\nMichelle Liu, Verite\nSee stories by Michelle Liu, Verite\n\ud83d\udc4b Looks like you could use more news.
