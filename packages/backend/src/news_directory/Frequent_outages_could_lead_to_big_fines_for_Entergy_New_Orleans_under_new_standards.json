(Photo by Julie Dermansky)\nThe New Orleans City Council established a new set of reliability standards Thursday for Entergy New Orleans that could lead to fines up to $3.7 million per year if the number of annual blackouts exceeds those standards. The council is the regulator of Entergy New Orleans.\n\u201cEntergy New Orleans must meet our standards or owe the people of New Orleans, their customers, millions of dollars in fines,\u201d Councilwoman Helena Moreno said at a utility committee meeting this month. \u201cI believe we\u2019re one of the only regulators in the southern region that\u2019s set up these types of reliability standards.\u201d\nThe council hopes the new standards will finally allow it to collect a $1 million fine it imposed on Entergy in 2019 over frequent outages. The fine was levied after a council investigation found that the grid\u2019s reliability fell sharply shortly after the company cut millions of dollars from its budget to maintain it.\nEntergy challenged the fine in court, arguing it was unfair because the council hadn\u2019t established reliability standards. An Orleans Parish Civil District Court judge ruled in Entergy\u2019s favor in June.\nMoreno\u2019s chief of staff Andrew Tuozzolo told Verite that the council\u2019s plan was now to re-levy the $1 million fine, in the hopes that the new reliability standards will make it easier to defend in court.\nThe new standards only apply to \u201cfair-weather day\u201d outages, and exclude outages caused by major events like hurricanes. The council is currently conducting a separate process to create new rules and improvement plans for the grid\u2019s storm resilience.\nWhile hurricane-related outages are a well-known and deadly occurrence in New Orleans, the city has also struggled for years with frequent outages on sunny days. In fact, the process to pass these new rules began in 2017, when complaints grew about the number of blackouts happening on clear days, when the grid should have been operating normally.\nIn 2019, a council investigation found that Entergy failed in its responsibility to maintain an adequate grid. It found the city experienced 2,599 outages between June 1, 2016 and May 31, 2017 alone, the majority of which occurred on fair weather days. The report said the main cause of the outages were equipment failures in the local distribution grid \u2014 the poles and lines that run down every street and deliver electricity directly to buildings.\nThe investigation also found that the grid\u2019s reliability started to fall shortly after Entergy New Orleans made multi-million dollar cuts to investing in distribution system maintenance and improvement. That investigation led to the council\u2019s decision to fine Entergy $1 million.\nUnder the measure passed Thursday, Entergy will have three new reliability standards that could lead to the fine.\nThe first standard is how many fair weather outages New Orleans customers face each year. That\u2019s based on an industry standard called the system average interruption frequency index (SAIFI). The minimum SAIFI established by the council is 1.53 \u2014 meaning that a customer in New Orleans should experience, on average, 1.53 outages per year. The exact fine depends on how off that mark Entergy was in a given year, with a maximum penalty of $2.7 million.\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\nDONATE\nThe second standard is about the duration of fair weather outages every year, based on the system average interruption duration index (SAIDI). The maximum baseline SAIDI score for Entergy was set at 178.2, meaning New Orleans customers on average would experience 178.2 minutes \u2014 roughly three hours \u2014 of outages each year. Entergy could face an annual fine of $500,000 for failing to achieve that.\nThe last standard could lead to fines up to $500,000 if Entergy fails to adequately improve the grid\u2019s worst performing feeders \u2014 a piece of equipment in the distribution system that has been blamed for outages in the past.\nThe council\u2019s ordinance notes that under the newly established fine schedule, Entergy\u2019s poor reliability in 2016 and 2017 \u2014 for which the council originally levied a $1 million fine \u2014 would have resulted in a fine of almost the exact same amount \u2014 $1,005,000.\nRepresentatives of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, which advocates on behalf of customers,  applauded the move. But they also said they believe the council should go farther and use these new standards as a starting point.\n\u201cWe\u2019re certainly supportive of having them in place, but we\u2019d like to note this is merely a first step,\u201d Alliance policy director Jesse George said at the utility meeting this month. \u201cWe encourage the council to continue making these standards more stringent over time.\u201d\nThe council\u2019s utility advisers noted that from 2013 through 2021, Entergy New Orleans would have only run afoul of the new standards in two years, 2016 and 2017.\n\u201cI think if you ask the average New Orleanian whether their electric service was reliable over the last five years they would probably say no,\u201d George said in a recent Facebook video.\nMoreno said during the committee meeting that because of pressure from the council, Entergy New Orleans had improved its reliability.\n\u201cTheir reliability is definitely not perfect, but it has improved due to insistence from the City Council,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cEntergy New Orleans has now increased its reliability performance to just above the national average. This is progress, but we are certainly far from done.\u201d\nEntergy did not respond to a request for comment.\nThis article first appeared on Verite and is republished here under a Creative Commons license.\nREPUBLISH\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.
