Its funding is determined by the City Council, and it is regulated by the Louisiana Legislature\u2019s laws.\nThat serving of three masters is the reason for historic neglect of the city\u2019s water infrastructure, leading to drainage failures, boil water advisories and a lack of accountability that worsen the risks of living in an already vulnerable city.\nThat is according to a new report from the Bureau of Governmental Research, which called for sweeping changes to the S&WB\u2019s governing structure. Either the S&WB needs to be abolished and folded completely into city government, or it needs far greater autonomy, the report said.\nStorm clouds move in around the Sewerage and Water Board water tower closest to Claiborne Av. at the Carrollton Water Plant in New Orleans, Friday, June 10, 2022.

We really need to choose one path or the other,\u201d said Rebecca Mowbray, BGR\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThe structure of the Sewerage and Water Board is really the root cause of a lot of the water-related problems that New Orleanians experience.\u201d\nMany of the recommendations are a repeat from 2011, when the BGR suggested a series of measures to strengthen the S&WB\u2019s independence. The report, issued Wednesday, reups some of those suggestions, such as creating metrics for the City Council to approve rate proposals and tax levies.\nConverting the utility to a city department is a new suggestion, one that BGR previously said was a bad idea because of City Hall dysfunction.\nMowbray said city leaders, including Mayor LaToya Cantrell, seem to have grown more focused on drainage after repeated street flooding in 2017. Still, the report says consolidation would require extensive planning to ensure City Hall is capable of subsuming 1,300 employees, an annual capital budget $440 million and another $580 million in outstanding debt.  \nOfficials open to changes\nA Sewerage and Water Board sticker is stuck to machinery inside a water tower at the Carrollton Water Plant in New Orleans, Friday, June 10, 2022.

The S&WB controls the primary pipes and pumping stations that push storm water out of the city, but the Department of Public Works maintains catch basins and smaller pipes that feed into the parts that the S&WB controls.\nThat arrangement \u2014 unique among 51 peer cities, according to BGR \u2014 has been a coordination nightmare and contributed to the 2017 floods, according to an analysis.\nThe Sewerage and Water Board's Carrollton plant is shown Tuesday, Dec. 7, 2021.\nSTAFF PHOTO BY DAVID GRUNFELD\nCity Council Vice President Helena Moreno has long championed giving control for all drainage components to the S&WB, in line with the BGR. But Moreno and the BGR differ when it comes to giving the S&WB funding for the additional workload.\nThe BGR says a storm water fee is likely needed. Moreno said merging the two systems would create cost savings.\n\u201cThis remains a no brainer situation,\u201d Moreno said in a prepared statement. \u201cThe operations and efficiency of (the S&WB) must improve and a drainage merger is a critical step that can\u2019t come soon enough.\u201d\nState oversight\nThe S&WB is subject to more than 80 state laws, giving lawmakers from every corner of the state a say in how the city\u2019s water systems are regulated.\nAnd with the mayor serving as the board president of a state-created utility, there is confusion over who is ultimately accountable for its management, .\nWater rates and tax levies are approved by the City Council, which, according to BGR, tends to cave to political pressure to keep rates low. That political pressure increases as infrastructure and public confidence erodes, and the cost burden gets kicked to future generations.\n\u201cThe City Council's hand in setting rates, it now injects too much politics,\u201d Cantrell told reporters on Wednesday. By the same token, the council lacks other ways to hold the S&WB accountable, the report says.\n\u201cOne of the few cards that they can really play is to raise hell about funding,\u201d Mowbray said.\nBilling woes\nThat dynamic surfaced last year, when the council refused to consider rate hikes until the S&WB fixed a meter reading system known to produce wildly inflated bills. The utility also has faced criticism for its difficult-to-navigate appeals process.\nWorkers investigate after an explosion at the the Sewerage & Water Board\u00d5s Carrollton water plant in New Orleans, Saturday, Dec. 14, 2019.

District A City Council member Joe Giarrusso said he\u2019s not opposed to the idea, but that council members\u2019 discretion should not be discarded entirely.\n\u201cIf billing isn\u2019t fixed, how do you go to the public who feels like they\u2019re paying more money than they should, and then say, by the way, we\u2019ve increased your sewer and water rates?\u201d Giarrusso said.\nMowbray credited Cantrell for hiring the S&WB\u2019s current executive director, Ghassan Korban, a civil engineer who previously ran Milwaukee\u2019s public works.\nWater flows into the street after an explosion at the Sewerage & Water Board\u00d5s Carrollton water plant in New Orleans, Saturday, Dec. 14, 2019. Three workers were injured in the explosion that harmed two turbines.\nStaff photo by SOPHIA GERMER\nUnder Korban\u2019s leadership, the S&WB has initiated capital projects to replace its drainage power and underground meters, both considered critical to improving the utility\u2019s service.\nThose two projects alone will run more than $350 million, however, and are part of the reason the S&WB is looking for more revenue.\nAs he has before, Giarrusso said the S&WB should do more to collect on delinquent bills. The S&WB says it was owed $60 million from bills more than 60 days late at the end of March.\nThe S&WB and City Council relationship is at a low point, with the council voting unanimously on May 11 to sue the S&WB for refusing to comply with some parts of new city ordinances related to billing.\nGlass lays on the ground on Spruce street behind the Sewerage & Water Board\u00d5s Carrollton water plant in New Orleans, Saturday, Dec. 14, 2019. Three workers were injured in the explosion that harmed two turbines.\nStaff photo by SOPHIA GERMER\nThat vote prompted Cantrell to order District C City Council member Freddie King to leave an S&WB executive session on Thursday about the possible upcoming litigation.\nKing serves as the council\u2019s representative on the S&WB, and the episode illustrated another issue identified by the BGR: the City Council representative on the S&WB is inherently conflicted, according to the report.\nGiarrusso said he understood why Cantrell booted King from the executive session, but disagreed that a council representative on the board is problematic.\nStill, he agreed there are too many cooks in the kitchen at the S&WB.\n\u201cWhen you have multiple responsibilities in government for a single function, you're almost destined for failure,\u201d Giarrusso said.\nEmail Ben Myers at bmyers@theadvocate.com.
