But it appears that almost all of those purchases violate a city law that mandates low emissions for city-owned vehicles.\nThe \u201cclean fleet\u201d ordinance, which the City Council approved last year, requires the city to stop buying gas-powered vehicles altogether in 2025. But the law also stipulates that starting in 2023, newly purchased city vehicles have to at least follow the same low-emissions standards required for the federal government as part of the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act.\nMayor LaToya Cantrell recently released a list of 2023 vehicle purchases. An analysis by Verite didn\u2019t identify a single car model that met those emissions standards.\nSome of the listed vehicles don\u2019t have the specific model number necessary to look up their emissions on the federal government\u2019s emissions database, including \u201c15 passenger vans\u201d and \u201cambulances.\u201d But of the 686 vehicles that do provide model information, none of them appear to meet the city\u2019s standards.\nMany of the vehicles don\u2019t even come close to meeting the standard, including SUVs with emissions two or three times higher than the threshold.\n\u201cMost concerning here is that not only are all of the vehicles gas, they\u2019re guzzlers,\u201d Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, told Verite.\nThe \u201cclean fleet\u201d ordinance does allow the city\u2019s Chief Administrative Officer, Gilbert Monta\u00f1o, to grant exceptions. But the law says that \u201cexemptions are disfavored and may only be approved on a case-by-case basis.\u201d It also requires Monta\u00f1o to provide a written explanation for each exemption that provides \u201ca substantial public-safety justification.\u201d\nA written statement from Cantrell\u2019s office on Thursday said that Monta\u00f1o \u201chas exercised his discretion to grant exemptions from the cited standard when appropriate.\u201d But the city did not respond to a request to provide copies of those exemptions by the time of publication.\nIn the statement, Cantrell\u2019s office said the high-emission vehicles were necessary due to \u201csupply chain challenges\u201d and because \u201cunfortunately, currently available vehicles that meet the cited standard are not effective for every job.\u201d\n\u201cThe age and functionality of the current fleet impacts the effectiveness of City services and carries a significant financial burden,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAs the vehicle designs improve and the marketplace recovers from its challenges, the City will purchase vehicles that meet the cited standard. \u2026 But the City will not risk the safety of City employees and the public in order to meet a standard that vehicle manufacturers have been unable to keep up with thus far.\u201d\nThe majority of the vehicles, 512 out of 791, went to the New Orleans Police Department. NOPD Superintendent Michelle Woodfork said in April that she planned to use vehicles to offer take-home cars for every NOPD officer. The rest of the money was spread over 29 other departments, including the Department of Safety and Permits, the Fire Department, the District Attorney\u2019s Office, the Mayor\u2019s Office and the New Orleans Public Library.\nBurke said that even if Monta\u00f1o did issue a formal exception for each of the vehicles, and the administration didn\u2019t violate the law, it was still a mistake to upgrade the city\u2019s fleet with the same high-emissions vehicles it\u2019s always relied on.\n\u201cIf municipalities like New Orleans pass policies intended to take climate action and act as a role model for people and businesses, it is vital that they follow their own rules,\u201d Burke said. \u201cOtherwise policies wind up as performance and handwaving, and that\u2019s how people lose confidence in their government.\u201d\nWhen the clean fleet ordinance was introduced by Councilwoman Helena Moreno last year, she said the fleet transition was a vital step for a city so vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.\nCantrell has framed herself as a leader on climate. She recently returned from a climate conference in South Korea, where, her office said in a press release, she was the only mayor in attendance.\n\u201cWe expect the Administration to understand and follow the law,\u201d Moreno said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cClimate leadership requires execution, not just rhetoric. I need to know why they failed to follow the law.\u201d\nMoreno and experts acknowledged from the start that transitioning the city\u2019s hundreds of vehicles to a low-emission fleet would cost money, and that they would likely need federal funds to help make that happen. And at the beginning of this year, when the new threshold went into effect, the city happened to be sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars in unallocated pandemic aid and surplus money.\nBurke\u2019s frustration over the new vehicle purchases is a sentiment shared by many local advocates and residents over the federal funds, the feeling that the city missed a rare golden opportunity to fund transformational projects, and instead doubled down on what it\u2019s already doing.\n\u201cThis specific example of the cars is a symptom of the problem \u2014 the failure to make these dollars and spending decisions align with community priorities,\u201d said Cashauna Hill, executive director of the Louisiana Fair Housing Action Center.\n\u2018The administration needs to make this all make sense\u2019\nThis is not the first time Cantrell has been criticized for how the city has used $388 million in federal pandemic relief aid it began receiving in mid-2021.\nAs 2022 was winding down, it became clear that the city hadn\u2019t spent almost any of the money. The big question was how the city should spend the unexpected windfall.\nThe administration told residents that there would be a public process to determine how to spend it. But that never happened, advocates said.\nOver the past six months, the administration and council quickly appropriated the vast majority of the money. Although all the cash was formally allocated in public council votes, residents, advocates and good government watchdogs have said the process has been last-minute, non-transparent and unaccountable.\n\u201cThe issue here is that what\u2019s happening is that the administration has gone out of its way to avoid having a transparent conversation about what they\u2019re choosing to spend money on and why,\u201d Hill said.\nHill and other advocates say they were pushed to the side, and that since almost all the money has been allocated, it may be too late. Hill was particularly adamant about the high level of federal funds Cantrell spent on the police, including the recent vehicle purchases.\n\u201cWe continue to hear that it\u2019s so difficult to recruit and attract and retain NOPD officers,\u201d Hill said. \u201cYet we\u2019re continuing to spend millions of dollars on vehicles for these nonexistent police officers to take home. The administration needs to make this all make sense. And so far they have refused to do that.\u201d\nThe NOPD has seen a big drop in its ranks in the past few years, at the same time that the city, and most of the country, experienced a rise in some violent crimes. Much of the ARPA funds have been dedicated to fixing that staffing problem at the NOPD, including a multimillion-dollar retention and recruitment package.\nTake-home vehicles for officers was also a recruiting recommendation provided by former New York police officers the city hired as consultants last year.\nLooking at the city\u2019s official allocations, it\u2019s difficult to tell exactly how much was spent on the NOPD. For example, $1.5 million for a new facility for NOPD\u2019s police dogs and horses was officially marked as a transfer of funds from the City Council to the Chief Administrative Office. It\u2019s also unclear how much of a $30 million criminal justice IT overhaul will go directly to the police.\nAccording to a city dashboard, of the first $141 million of federal pandemic funds the city appropriated to special projects, 62% went to \u201cpublic safety.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of the exact amount [spent on NOPD], my guess would be that it\u2019s the majority.\u201d Hill said. \u201cThey are clearly showing us what their actual priorities are. \u2026 It seems like this administration has fully decided that giving more money to the NOPD is the way we\u2019re going to address what they\u2019re calling a historic crime wave.\u201d\nHill said that once again, government officials are failing to take a holistic approach to the community\u2019s problems, failing to see the connections between safety and housing and education and transportation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a short-sighted plan,\u201d Hill said. \u201cBecause it fails once again to address the actual needs of community members, and instead gives into fear and continues to pad the budget of the NOPD, which has not helped us.\u201d\nThis article first appeared on Verite and is republished here under a Creative Commons license.
