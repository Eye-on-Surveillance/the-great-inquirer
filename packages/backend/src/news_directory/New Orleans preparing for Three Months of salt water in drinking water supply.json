Here's a timeline.\nPlans made to barge in 36 million gallons of fresh water a day\n\"About 90 days is what we've been told by the Corps of Engineers,\" Arnold said after addressing a City Council committee meeting on the subject. \n\"So we'd be looking at maybe the end of January under under those circumstances.\"\nArnold noted that caution was necessary when estimating timeframes given the unknowns related to the forecast, but said that was the current thinking. Sufficient rain must occur in the Mississippi River basin to flush out the salt moving up from the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe current forecast shows salt reaching the intakes for New Orleans' Carrollton water plant, which supplies water to the city's east bank, around Oct. 28. \nArnold said New Orleans and Jefferson Parish were now focusing on building a pipeline for the east bank in both parishes because barges delivering water would not provide sufficient capacity.\nCost estimates for the pipeline are anywhere from $100 million to $250 million, but federal funds could cover the majority given the White House's disaster declaration for the saltwater intrusion.\nArnold says he hopes construction could begin on the pipeline in seven to 10 days, so long as officials are able to get expedited contracting and approvals.\nContractors are offering assurances that the work could be completed despite the short timeframe, but officials are preparing for the possibility of making bottled water available if there is a gap. The city is also looking at water conservation methods, Arnold said.\nArnold stressed that the city's water remains safe and drinkable. He called on residents not to panic and said the situation was manageable. \nEmail Mike Smith at msmith@theadvocate.com or follow him on Twitter, @MikeJSmith504.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nPrint\nCopy article link\nSave\nMORE INFORMATION\nEverything you need to know about salt water moving inland in Louisiana, including a tracker\nSalt water is creeping up the mouth of the Mississippi River and threatening the drinking supply of several parishes in Southeast Louisiana, i\u2026\nCantrell: Biden administration has issued disaster declaration on saltwater intrusion\nMayor LaToya Cantrell on Wednesday said President Joe Biden has moved forward with a federal disaster declaration for the saltwater intrusion \u2026\n+7\nHow would salt water affect my lawn, garden?
