The City council members considered an ordinance Monday that would restrict the distribution of food to homeless encampments. They cited issues with food dumping leading to rodent infestations. But the proposal spurred pushback from advocates who say that the more pressing issue is the city's failure to maintain sanitary conditions at the encampments, due to insufficient trashcans and portable toilet sanitation Monday, July 24, 2023.

A violation would be punishable with a fine of up to $500 or six months in jail, or both, at the discretion of a judge.\nIn the days leading up to the meeting and in the council's crowded chambers Monday, advocates deplored an ordinance many said they interpreted as criminalizing the act of giving food to people who need it. \nGreen emphasized repeatedly throughout the hours-long council meeting that the bill did not penalize food distribution, but rather leaving waste that can attract rodents \u2014 perhaps by hosts stuck with leftovers after a catered event or restaurants at the end of the night. But he agreed ultimately that the ordinance's wording needed work. \nAnother bill drafted by Councilmember Lesli Harris that would have created a communications campaign directing people to donate to local charities rather than providing food directly to the homeless encampments was also deferred. \nThe two false starts highlight the council's struggle to address a crisis in the city's homeless encampments, where an increasing number of people face unsanitary and dangerous conditions. \n\"Encampment conditions are probably the worst that I have ever seen them,\" said Taylor Diles, environmental health coordinator for the New Orleans Health Department and part of a panel of experts convened to report on camp conditions, told the council Monday. \"We have really areas that are overrun with rodents; it's a really significant challenge.\"\nHomelessness in the city has increased by 15% between 2022 and 2023, said Martha Kegel, executive director of UNITY of Greater New Orleans, a homeless services organization. It's the largest increase in homelessness since Hurricane Katrina. \nThe growth in the size of the city's encampments means that cleaning them now takes significantly longer, said Diles. And after the Police Department said in early 2023 that there were not enough officers to support weekly cleaning, the Health Department has moved to a biweekly schedule. \nDr. Jennifer Avegno, director of that department, agreed with the council that dumping of inedible or unsafe food has created additional sanitation problems.\n\"For various reasons, individuals and organizations frankly dump things that are really unfit for any consumption,\" said Avegno. \"We've seen boxes and boxes of rotten bananas, trays and plates of raw meat.\"\nBut other panelists said the majority of the donated food is safe and necessary.\n\"Hunger is very, very serious in the encampments,\" said Angela Owczarek, a street outreach worker with Travelers Aid Society, who said people in encampments often rely on donations from passersby for food after many of the homeless services organizations have finished their daily distributions. \nFar more pressing than food dumping, Owczarek said, is the city's failure to provide enough trash cans and keep portable toilets clean. \nMany encampments have no trashcans at all, said Owczarek. People in the encampments have begun using portable toilets as trash receptacles instead, Dr. Avegno said, making them difficult for the company contracted to service the toilets to clean them. In recent months, the company, United Rentals, has instead begun shoveling the contents of the toilets, including human waste, directly onto the ground, advocates said.\nDepartment of Sanitation director Matt Torri told the council that the distribution of additional trash cans had been held up by a delay on the shipment of chains that would prevent people from taking them. He said the department received the equipment Monday and would begin installing the cans immediately. Diles said the Health Department is working to come up with a better reporting system to hold United Rentals accountable for proper servicing. \nThe city recently recently appropriated millions of dollars to a project to address homelessness, including a $738,000 contract with Clutch Consulting Group, which will work with UNITY to house residents of the camps. But Kegel said that even that sweeping effort won't solve the issue as new people lose housing every day, struggling with high rents and a shortage of affordable units.\n\"Until we really invest more heavily in affordable housing, I don\u2019t see an end in sight,\" said Kegel. \nAnother bill, drafted by Harris, that would allow city crews to dispose of appliances like refrigerators, microwaves, or air conditioners, dumped food, and property deemed abandoned \u2014 unless the items are determined to be personal property \u2014 will be voted on by the council on Thursday.\nEditor's note: This story was changed July 26 to correct the amount of the City's contract with Clutch Consulting Group. \nEmail Sophie Kasakove at Sophie.Kasakove@TheAdvocate.com or follow her on Twitter, @Sophie_Kasakove.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nPrint\nCopy article link\nSave\nTags\nHardwall\nThis Day in History\nSponsored by Connatix\nRecommended for you\nRecommended by\nSECTIONS\nHOME\nNEWS\nOPINION\nSPORTS\nENTERTAINMENT/LIFE\nNEWSLETTERS\nGAMES\nSERVICES\nCLASSIFIEDS\nSEARCH\nSUBSCRIBE | GROUPS\nDIGITAL ADVERTISING\nHELP/CONTACT US\nRSS FEEDS\nMEDIA KIT\nEEDITION\nCAREERS\nTEACHER'S LINK\nREVIEWING THE RECORD\nOUR SITES\nOBITUARIES\nJOBS\nCELEBRATIONS\nNIE\nCLASSIFIEDS\nHOMES\nPETS\nARCHIVES\nSTORE\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nnola.com\n840 St. Charles Avenue\nNew Orleans, LA 70130\nPhone: 504-529-0522\n\nNews Tips:\nnolanewstips@theadvocate.com\nOther questions:\nsubscriberservices@theadvocate.com\nNeed help?\nReport a delivery issue\nCreate a temporary stop\nSign up for recurring payments\nPay your bill\nUpdate your billing info\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2023 NOLA.com 840 St. Charles Avenue, New Orleans, LA  | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy\nPowered by BLOX Content Management System from BLOX Digital.\nThis website stores data such as cookies to enable essential website functionality, marketing, personalization and analytics.
