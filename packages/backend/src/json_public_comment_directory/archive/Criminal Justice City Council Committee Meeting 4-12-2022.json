I do not want everyone\u0092s face to be ran through a system to identify them every time they step outside. That is an invasion of privacy. I have not seen evidence or studies that say surveillance will make us safer. Money and resources that will be used for surveillance would be better spent by investing in schools and economic opportunity. This surveillance leads down a bad path and does not provide enough, or any, benefits to outweigh the negatives and abuse of the technology that will follow. -CLC",
