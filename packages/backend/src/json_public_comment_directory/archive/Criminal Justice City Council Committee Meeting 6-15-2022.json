NOPD has been shackled by:\n1) A perpetual US Justice Department Consent Decree and overburdening oversight, \n2) The erosion of NOPD command, the dwindling number of patrol staff, and the inability to attract new officers, \n3) An unrelenting explosion in violent crime.\nIf properly implemented and effectively used, License Plate Reader (LPR), facial recognition, and other advanced technology will significantly assist NOPD in the investigation and case closure of violent felonies. Also, predictive, and preventive actions could enable NOPD to get ahead of repetitive criminal activity.\nGive NOPD the tools. If over time, the Consent Decree oversight committee, the District Attorney, or Criminal Judges believe NOPD is abusing the technologies and discriminating against individuals, then they will force NOPD to adjust or cease its use. \nTo further disadvantage the NOPD by prohibiting the use of proven, advanced policing technologies would be negligent.\nThank you for the opportunity to comment.\nSincerely,\nRoger Fullmer",

As of today, we see more violence in our streets. So where is the measured return for the investment? Let's review one camera in particular at Hayne and Vincent. A murder happened at that intersection and the false hope of justice was realized when it was determined the camera system was broken. This was after Cox cable determined that the camera was broken over 2 weeks prior to the incident. The next day contractors replaced the camera. Since then there have been dumping and constant car burglaries and a business under redevelopment window bust. I reported this to officers, yet there has not been any follow-up. The criminals know the cameras are ineffective. How effective can it be when there is a culture to wear hoods and full facial masks year-round? As for using cameras to stop dumping, that does not work either. The new camera on Hayne and Paris is only watching an Oak Tree that is being preserved by an unknown group. There was a recent cleanup on Paris Rd. thanks to Councilman Thomas, however, wasn't the camera supposed to catch these people? Can you show us the total investment into the camera system, the number of violent criminals arrested in relation to an investment in family support and mental health, and community development.",

            "page_content": "Your agenda doesn't include what portions of the surveillance ordinance are looking to be rewritten so I am sending the same letter I sent to the full city council when they tried to review this topic in February. Stop trying to sneak turning New Orleans into a surveillance state past your constituency! It's gross and a wild misuse of your power!:\n\nImplementing the proposed ordinance, giving broad discretion to \u0093any city official\u0094 to use surveillance technology to \u0093locate a named suspect\u0094 is poorly drafted, poorly thought out legislation that is inviting a lawsuit on a number of grounds, starting with the 4th Amendment right to be free of unreasonable search and seizure. \n\nLawsuits that will further tax city resources to defend. I can\u0092t believe, as a former assistant city attorney, that the current city attorney and their staff would allow such poorly drafted legislation to stand as a council item, knowing that this is an indefensible government overreach without any justification that flies in the face of established legal precedence. \n\nThis standard does not require probable cause or sign off from a judge. It does not even require a law enforcement officer to execute it, but any city employee. This ordinance is immediately ripe for abuse. There is no oversight mechanism on who, how, when, and where this technology can be used and absolutely no limits on the type of technology to be used. Additionally, there is no restriction on what can be done with the information once it is obtained. \n\nThe people of New Orleans asked to be safer. They have asked for the police to do their job without harming the individuals of this city, a task they have regularly failed at, as they do not prevent, stop, or solve most crimes in this city. And the city\u0092s response is to give them more money and more tools to surveil us? We did not ask to live in a surveillance state, we asked to be safe. This does nothing to make us safer and in fact is a wild intrusion on our rights to be free. \n\nThere is no definition of \u0093named\u0094, there\u0092s not even a definition of \u0093suspect\u0094 and you want us to give every employee of this city the ability to access private information about its citizens without any formal oversight? Absolutely not. I would oppose this ordinance under the best of circumstances and you have not provided a single good circumstance. \n\nI have serious questions about data related to these intrusive violations of our right to privacy and how it will be stored, who will have access to this information, what will be done to keep the information private, and what should happen should this data be used against someone in a manner not foreseen, which is incredibly likely given the broad applicability of this ordinance. \n\nAdditionally, in a city that already over-policies its communities of color, facial recognition data will most assuredly only further exacerbate this issue and has been shown to be racist. \n\nThis is an absolute overstep by the city under the guise of keeping people safe, when it will actually make us less safe from government invasion into our lives. I do not consent to be surveilled in this manner, I do not consent to having any members of my community surveilled in this manner. I reject the idea that providing an already over-funded police department with more tools for them to abuse keeps us safe in any way. \n\nIt would behoove the city council to remember that their fiduciary obligation is to all citizens of this city, not just the vocal minority that unjustifiably believes they are in danger of violent crime when even the recent uptick in that area is poorly framed and illusory. You have a duty to those that may be accused of a crime as well and to protect their best interests. That means that this proposed ordinance, which only further serves to disenfranchised, should be immediately thrown out.",

The fact of the matter is \u0096 while the city officials and NOPD are trying to ram this regressive rollback through council at great cost to our city, we should remember that surveillance technology does not keep our communities safe. \n\nThink about the crises that we are going through that do not get addressed every time we install a new camera, or invest in tools for punishment instead of care. That's what this rollback is about \u0096 it is both materially and ideologically about opposing the movement for Black and brown lives that came together in 2020 to say \"no,\" resoundingly, to policing, police brutality, and the murder of Black and brown people at the hands of police, that incarceration and punishment are not the answers to violence.\n\nThis is Racist Technology TM, that has been proven by data scientists to misidentify Black and brown people and WOMEN at rates far higher than white people and men. Even Chief Ferguson knows this and has noted in public that there are concerns there! A 2019 Study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology found that face recognition algorithms CATEGORICALLY do not perform as well when examining the faces of women and people of color. The people of this city already know the poor performance of our city's other technology \u0096 just look at how the Sewerage and Water Board overcharges people regularly! Now they're asking us to trust that this technology that has proven anti-Black, anti-Women bias will work perfectly? That's not acceptable. That doesn't keep us safe.\n\nTo that end, the only thing besides RACIAL PROFILING that this technology does is WASTE OUR CITY'S RESOURCES on profit-driven corporations, using this city's coffers as their own personal piggy bank. We should be well aware that there are scam artists out there trying to make a buck off of surveilling our citizens. That's exactly what council subpoenaed the mayor about with the ongoing \"Smart Cities\" debacle. I am asking city council to show the same level of scrutiny here, and oppose this ordinance. The expensive technology is not the answer to our city\u0092s problems.\n\nWe should be sending our resources elsewhere \u0096 healthcare, childcare, education, how about housing our residents? We are all struggling day-to-day right now in the face of price-gouging on everything from healthcare costs, astronomical rent, food, fuel, and the list goes on.

We are a volunteer group originally formed under the Safety and Justice Challenge to ensure that community voices are taken into consideration when decisions are made that impact the criminal legal system. I am writing today to voice our opposition to Ord. 33,639.\n\nOne of the primary functions of NOVAS is to hold stakeholders accountable to their commitment to safely reduce the jail population here in New Orleans. In order to hold stakeholders accountable to policy, we have to know what those policies are, and what tools they have at their disposal to enforce them. Prior to the passage of the ordinance banning this technology in 2020, members of the community were assured that no ban was necessary, because law enforcement was not using these harmful surveillance technologies anyway. Come to find out, NOPD had been secretly using facial recognition software through its partnership with Louisiana State Police (who are currently under federal investigation by the DOJ for use of excessive force and racially biased policing). This lack of transparency confirms that we need safeguards in place to protect the public from racially biased and harmful policing.\n\nWe also know these technologies have been historically weaponized to target Black and brown communities, and that facial recognition algorithms are more likely to mis-identify non-white faces. In a city where 86% of the jail population is Black (compared to 60% of the general population), we should be looking for ways to reduce ethnic and racial disparities in our criminal legal system. This ordinance would be a step in the wrong direction.\n\nFinally, there is no evidence that additional surveillance does anything to prevent or reduce crime. We are in agreement that all New Orleanians deserve to feel safe in their own city, but safety does NOT come from additional policing or surveillance measures. We ask that you instead invest in long-term solutions such as affordable and available housing, employment opportunities and fair wages, childcare and education, and other programs that deter crime from occurring in the first place. This is the path to a better New Orleans, not further criminalization of its residents.\n\nCommunity members have spoken loud and clear. We do not want surveillance technology that is expensive, racially biased, and ultimately ineffective at preventing or reducing crime. I ask you to oppose Ord. 33,639.",

The crime spike is a symptom of systemic issues and surveillance does not solve them.\n\nDuring the city council meeting last week, a fireman made a public comment on bolstering mental health crisis response. This was brought up in regards to domestic violence and would be an actual proactive approach, a popular one at that, to that type of criminal act. We can use this initiative an apply it to other factors that lead to the insurmountable stress and desperation that leads people to commit crimes, like investing in public schools instead of the charter scam, green spaces and recreation, and financial stability programs like universal basic income.\n\nThe software analyzing the footage from the cameras is still inherently racist. Images of white faces are more easily processed which means black and brown people are disproportionately misidentified. This feeds our systemically racist judicial system instead of reforming it. The city council would be ill advised to approve this ordinance, toss this band-aid non-solution out, let\u0092s get some proactive solutions instead of reactive ones that don\u0092t work.",

We know from extensive data that surveillance does not stop crime or make cities safer, and ignoring the overwhelming data in favor of political fanfare is disrespectful to the constituents that you serve. The millions of dollars spent on the existing surveillance cameras have done nothing to deter or prevent crime or alleviate NOPD staffing issues. We should be spending money on community services like developing affordable housing, free and low-cost healthcare, expanding public transit, and creating well-paying jobs with good benefits. \n\nInstead of supporting people whose needs are not being met, this ordinance will contribute to privacy violations and target already vulnerable communities in New Orleans. Please vote no on the ordinance.",

This is a waste of our taxpayer money and distracts from systemic solutions. There are so many alternatives to reducing crime that don't rely on more police and prisons, such as engaging a robust crisis intervention team, continuing cash payments to folks who are struggling, investing in our schools and in green space, and much more! Surveillance tools of all types continue to show racial bias and entrench racist systems, no matter who is creating the algorithm or watching the camera. The consent decree over NOPD is about restoring people's individual liberties. Investing in more surveillance counters this objective and goes against the larger social trend of increasing skepticism of surveillance in our lives. \n",

Giving NOPD carte blanche to use surveillance tools is troubling given their demonstrated history of dishonesty around the department's use of facial recognition software.

In my opinion the residents of New Orleans overwhelmingly support this Amendment. Facial recognition has become a commonplace tool for law enforcement officers at both the federal and municipal levels. Of the approximately 42 federal agencies that employ law enforcement officers, the GAO discovered in 2021 that about half used facial recognition. Of course the use of this technology is not without challenges and limitations, which is why the Brookings Institute, in its paper presented to the American Bar Association Antitrust Spring Meeting last month, supported this technology with the installation of some safeguards.\n\nSection 147-2, subsection (d) establishes reasonable safeguards. Face surveillance technology can only be used in very specific situations and evidence obtained from face surveillance alone shall not be sufficient to establish probable cause for the purpose of effectuating an arrest. \n\nIn addition, there must be appropriate training and frequent model validation to ensure effective and appropriate use of this technology. Appropriate training and model validation are necessary to prevent the unfair or inaccurate profiling of people of color. Safeguards are appropriate to ensure everyone is treated fairly.\n\nI understand that there is no \"singular answer\" to the violent crime surge occurring in this City. I recognize that the answer is complex and the solution will not occur overnight. As a resident of this City, I am literally begging you to take appropriate action and approve this Amendment. It will protect our residents and assist our police officers with investigating crime and locating violent criminals with arrest warrants. Please do the right thing!!\n\n",

The resources that would go to additional surveillance could easily be used for other services helping non-violent offenders in ways that will actually decrease crime and support those in need while the majority of the police can re-focus on more pressing crime around the city.

Nearly 18 months ago, residents collectively decided that surveillance would not keep us safe. Despite the gun violence and carjackings that many New Orleanians have seen on the news or unfortunately have experienced, surveillance technologies will still not keep us safe. They provide the perception of safety with none of the actual benefits. Surveillance tech is not a force multiplier. It is not a deterrent of criminal activity. It does not increase public safety.\n\nThese are reactive and costly tools that have been misused by other municipalities across the country, led to the misidentification and incorrect arrest of Black people and are rooted in the violent, inhumane and racist history of slavery. Since 2017, over 10 million dollars has been spent on surveilance in New Orleans and we have absolutely nothing to show for it.\n\nThere's been much debate and discussion for well over a year about the rise in crime that we've been experiencing. Crime is loosely defined as \"an action or omission that constitutes an offense.\" As we attempt to push along and through year three of the COVID-19 pandemic, crime is the historic levels of unemployment our residents face. Crime is the lack of affordable housing due to the continual inundation of Air B&Bs. Crime is the food insecurity that leads to dozens upon dozens of cars parked hours in advance outside of weekly Culture Aid NOLA food distribution sites, crime is the repeated closing of schools and lapse in education that our youth experience due to an ineffective charter system.\n\nAll of these things and so much more could begin to be solved by the money that continues to be pumped into the city's surveillance apparatus and police department. I urge the members of the Criminal Justice Committee to say no to additional forms of surveillance and no to Ordinance 33,639.",
