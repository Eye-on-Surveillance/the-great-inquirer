Specific steps would include adding back the enforcement clause from the Ordinance 33,021 so that the people can hold the New Orleans Police Department when they break the law. The City should halt any expansion of technologies that risk our personal identities until a study is conducted, with oversight from the community, on the efficacy of the City's current resources is completed. The City should then use those results to inform a comprehensive strengthening of current ordinance. Most importantly, money divested from the ineffective use of surveillance and away from big business, should be distributed to local grassroots organizations. You can check your inboxes for the names of a few. Vote no on 33639.",

It never works. It does nothing to ameliorate the social conditions that inevitably lead to crime. If anything, it contributes to existing inequities. New Orleans' ban on facial recognition software had placed this city at the forefront of evolving better ways to deal with criminal justice. Now, after the pandemic has deepened the rifts between the haves and the have-nots in this city, crime is inevitably on the rise. We cannot backslide by falling into outmoded ways of dealing with crime, ways of dealing with the problem that never worked in the first place. I urge you to uphold the ban on facial recognition software and to instead direct the city's resources toward tacking these problems at the root by investing in infrastructure and our communities.",

Concentrate on funding the community, reducing poverty, and addressing our housing crisis if you want crime to go down.",

This ain't about stopping violent crime, considering the volume of non-violent arrests using crime camera footage. Policing and surveillance won't prevent crime, no matter how sophisticated the technology is. Please vote no",

I can\u0092t believe that the current city attorney would allow such poorly drafted legislation to stand, knowing that this is an indefensible government overreach without any justification that flies in the face of established legal precedence. \n\nThis standard does not require probable cause or sign off from a judge. It does not even require a law enforcement officer to execute it, but any city employee. This ordinance is immediately ripe for abuse. There is no oversight mechanism on who, how, when, and where this technology can be used and absolutely no limits on the type of technology to be used. Additionally, there is no restriction on what can be done with the information once it is obtained. \n\nThe people of New Orleans asked to be safer. They have asked for the police to do their job without harming the individuals of this city, a task they have regularly failed at, as they do not prevent, stop, or solve most crimes in this city. And the city\u0092s response is to give them more money and more tools to surveil us? We did not ask to live in a surveillance state, we asked to be safe. This does nothing to make us safer and in fact is a wild intrusion on our rights to be free. \n\nImmediately the city is going to invite lawsuits on this matter AND weaken their ability to prosecute cases by having cases thrown out for violations of 4th amendment rights. \n\nThere is no definition of \u0093named\u0094, there\u0092s not even a definition of \u0093suspect\u0094 and you want us to give every employee of this city the ability to access private information about its citizens without any formal oversight? Absolutely not. I would oppose this ordinance under the best of circumstances and you have not provided a single good circumstance. \n\nI have serious questions about data related to these intrusive violations of our right to privacy and how it will be stored, who will have access to this information, what will be done to keep the information private, and what should happen should this data be used against someone in a manner not foreseen, which is incredibly likely given the broad applicability of this ordinance. \n\nAdditionally, in a city that already over-policies it\u0092s communities of color, facial recognition data will most assuredly only further exacerbate this issue and has been shown to be racist. \n\nIt would behoove the city council to remember that their fiduciary obligation is to all citizens of this city, not just the vocal minority that unjustifiably believe they are in danger of violent crime, when even the recent uptick in that area is poorly framed and illusory. You have a duty to those that may be accused of a crime as well and to protect their best interests (which considering relatives of council members are under FBI investigation should not be a stretch of the imagination\u0085relatives who work for the police department we want to expand rights to). That means that this proposed ordinance, which only further serves to disenfranchise people who are already constantly disenfranchised, should be immediately thrown out.\n\nI urge the city council to oppose passing this ordinance. And if you choose to implement this, I look forward to watching the ACLU or other organization absolutely shred you apart for this. \n\n",

Safety is not more surveillance. The money that would be spent on this technology should be used to actually address problems that lead to residents feeling unsafe, such as: more affordable housing, job security, better public transportation, and community programs. \n\nAs your constituent, I urge you to vote NO on Ord. 33639.

Rather than reducing discrimination and targeted oppression, use of these technologies put all of us under a suspicious Orwellian eye. The residents of New Orleans deserve safety in the form of resources, opportunities, and social safety nets, not this pro-carceral and punitive reaction to crime. Crime, I may add, that is often borne from our communities long standing lack of said resources. Rather than address the real issue, the expansion of a surveillance state only focuses on the end result of decades of abuse and neglect our people have endured. Reversing the decision to ban facial recognition and other surveillance tools only speaks to the wishy-washy nature of politicians that so many people find detestable. Our city should be on the forefront of protecting civil liberties in the South. Do not drag us back towards regressive notions of control when you could instead focus on building our city up!",

Where are the resolutions to demand better from hotels and restaurants? To demand a living wage where parents don't have to work 2/3 jobs just to pay every increasing prices and rent, where is the demand for quality and free healthcare for the people that make New Orleans the destination it's known for? \n\nWhat I see is a naked attempt to OVERPOLICE our communities. Real crime has been on the decline for decades now, it is know that only 2% or crime is ever \"brought to justice\" despite having the most bloated and obscene budgets while working people suffer.\nWhat CAL. NO. 33,639 does is ignore the real ROOT OF THE PROBLEM and instead deals with it's symptoms. Are we serious about living in a safe new orleans?

We need to work on building communities of trust together. You, as our elected officals, are endangering that trust by backtracking on hard won resistance against criminalization and surveillance culture. Food, gas, and housing prices are at an all time high. Workers' rights in this city are atrocious. Public transport needs so much more investment. Creating and maintaining jobs that pay a living wage is essential. If you actually focus on service to the people in these ways, they will not need to engage in violent and harmful behaviors. Please refocus with intention. We all know that criminalization and surveillance hurt our Black community members the most. We will not accept this status quo.\n\nWe all want to feel safe in our city, but Ord. 33639 is a step in the wrong direction. I write to you to say in the strongest possible terms that surveillance does not equal safety. In fact, given the racist history of surveillance and the current racial biases built into surveillance technologies, the city\u0092s use of surveillance technologies to monitor and control its residents actually decreases safety for Black and brown New Orleanians and erodes public trust in a government meant to protect us all. The City Council made the right move in December 2020 with the passage of Ord 33021. Please say NO to Ord. 33639.\n\nBefore giving NOPD free reign to use New Orleans as a testing ground for wasteful and racist technology, we need comprehensive civil liberty protections in place and transparent reporting on the use of technology. The money spent purchasing and acquiring new surveillance technologies could be used instead to address the root problems of crime: funding affordable housing, job training programs, revamping the RTA, and freedom from criminalization.\n\nAs your constituent, I urge you to vote NO on Ord. 33639.",

I am a homeowner in Faubourg St. John and have lived across the street from the Fairgrounds for six years. I am very familiar with the 21 existing zoning provisos that Churchill Downs is required to comply with and, unfortunately, have also been aware of their lack of compliance with many of those provisos during the time I've lived here. Of particular concern is the lack of compliance with the requirement to provide 24/7 security patrol in the neighborhoods adjacent to their property. Again, I believe Council should defer approval of this requested zoning change to expand gambling operations until Churchill Downs can demonstrate to the Council and neighbors that they are in full compliance with the existing proviso requirements.

I am referring to zoning provisos governing noise, litter, lighting, the Fair Grounds patrol, and the security fence that is supposed to have landscaped screening to serve as a buffer between the race track and its neighbors. The latter provision has never been fulfilled, and as a result vast gaps along the fence provide no visual or auditory barrier for neighboring residents.

I understand that those proposing the ordinance were not on the Council at that time, but would respectfully suggest they review all the evidence and commentary submitted at that time before dragging our citizens through this process again. We were lied to about the use of facial recognition in the past. It was used in ways that were intrusive. That's why most agencies were kicked out of the RTCC. The eagerness to resume its use only makes it appear that there is an interest in using it \"at all costs\" again. This is not acceptable. Remember the adage: Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\n\nMore surveillance will not prevent car jackings. It has been proven time and again that these tools do little to nothing to reduce crime.
