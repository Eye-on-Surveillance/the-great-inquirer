These technologies are also tied with human rights abuses worldwide. Given the historical landscape of racism in surveillance and social science research, we must NOT allow our city to be a testing ground for these technologies. We must invest in smart, sustainable, PROVEN strategies to improve health and safety. Yes on 33021, but only with a full ban on the four technologies listed.",

We don't need New Orleans to be a testing ground for invasive and racially biased surveillance, as it already has been during a secret predictive policing contract with tech giant Palantir. As a movement sweeps across the country advocating for Black lives and urging us to shift our priorities away from tools and policies that further criminalize our neighbors, it is vital that we respond to this call here in New Orleans and vote YES on Ordinance 33021 as introduced. This ordinance is not taking any tools away as proponents of surveillance might say. It is pumping the brakes and ensuring that we understand the full scope and history of the ways these technologies have been used to seriously harm those already impacted by mass incarceration and the war on working people. It is laying the ground work for a more open and transparent process, and protects citizens from further criminalization and incarceration. This policy brings us one step closer to ensure equity for all citizens. We know there is no 'quick fix' for crime, but we also know that more policing and surveillance does not decrease crime, only increases incarceration. We need a crime prevention policy that addresses the root causes: education, affordable housing, access to good jobs. Surveillance might seem like a quick fix for crime but in fact is a harmful encroachment of the police into the lives of everyday people. Please support this ordinance as introduced, including a ban on new ALPRs, new characteristic tracking, facial recognition, and stingrays. These tools are harmful and invasive. Thank you.",

As you know the ordinance gives the City Council the ability to review all future surveillance technologies adopted by the city as well as putting an outright ban on FACIAL RECOGNITION technology- which is proven to be highly susceptible to error and misidentification, particularly in communities of color and on marginalized citizens. I think we can all agree that giving the City Council, who has the most direct line of communication with the citizens they represent, the ability to closely regulate technology employed against our communities is a wise and prudent choice, which why I am in full support of ORD 33021. I STRONGLY urge you to vote in favor of this bill before it moves to the full city council for a vote on July 16th- where you should again support it. Additionally the watered down language you're seeking is including removing the ban on ALPR's is unacceptable. Pass the Ordinance as it's written. STOP endlessly disappointing your citizens for profit.",

Although we haven't seen any evidence that these types of public safety measures actually reduce crime, we have seen several instances across the country and most importantly, in our own city where black, brown and other marginalized citizens have been targeted and criminalized with current surveillance tools. Oversight and accountability for these tools are necessary for our city to sustain itself during both the current economic crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. New Orleans needs and deserves more inclusive community driven processes that invest resources directly into our communities, not additional surveillance tech that will only further perpetuate racial biases and provide an influx to our carceral system.",

There are numerous studies confirming the racial biases that this technology already has, we CANNOT have this tech continue to negatively affect communities of color. With mass surveillance, everyone is treated as a suspect or criminal with the constant watchful eye in the sky. Our privacy is no longer sacred and perpetually violated with technology like facial recognition used with public and/or police cameras. Ordinance 33,021 protects the everyday citizens of New Orleans from technology that can be and has been used to punish wrongfully identified people, and protects us from the constant privacy violation of identifying every public move we make.
