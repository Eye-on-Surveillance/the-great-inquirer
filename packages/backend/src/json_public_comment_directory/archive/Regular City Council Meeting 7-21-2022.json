Given the totality of evidence of over a century of NOPD corruption, abuse & their inability to make our communities safer, it seems negligent to once again consider giving them more access to tools & technologies that are frankly dangerous. Especially in a moment when there is a clear, demonstrated need across so many basic aspects of life for New Orleanians: affordable housing, healthcare, utility bills, debt, un-liveable wages, trauma from hurricanes & pandemics. Simultaneously there is overwhelming evidence across multiple research sectors showing that violence is prevented most effectively by meeting these needs. And there is overwhelming public awareness and support for alternatives to policing, for community investment and policies that will immediately alleviate widespread, preventable suffering. You consider this ordinance as we can all look at an uncertain near future- so close we can feel it- in which fascist, authoritarian governments use the power of ubiquitous surveillance to repress political dissent, free expression, or even to spy on and target entire communities with genocidal intent. Even now, we face a present moment filled with fear about where people can access healthcare like abortion, or children will be able to learn about or talk about in school, or whether trans people will be allowed to exist in Louisiana. You cannot promise us safety, accountability or oversight with these tools. You can\u0092t. And even if you could, this is not what we want and this will not make us any safer. Lastly, seeing as how the council has previously sought to investigate the Mayor\u0092s office contract process under the Smart City\u0092s initiative, it seems odd that this council would not pursue a serious investigation of the allegations of misconduct pertaining to the so-called \u0093NOLA Coalition\u0092s\u0094 involvement in publicly pushing for this ordinance. Specifically the role of GNO Inc. and its key partners who have allegedly engaged in widespread manipulation, misinformation and the inappropriate use of private funds to coerce the participation of community organizations. A group pushing for technologies that would- at minimum- require deep & sustained levels of trust, transparency & oversight, should not be engaged in back room dealing, adding coalition members without knowledge or consent, or flying to Israel to meet with surveillance tech companies that currently contract with JPSO. Especially when key the people involved have a documented history of enabling and participating in Palantir\u0092s secretive and potentially unconstitutional \u0093predictive policing\u0094 program in New Orleans- especially those formerly employed by the Mayor. This fact alone should give this council great pause. People\u0092s lives are on the line. There is no good version of this ordinance. We deserve so much better.",

These systems can be used to identify people in photos, videos, or in real-time. However, face recognition software is notoriously bad at recognizing women, young people, African Americans, and other ethnic minorities, often misidentifying them. \n\nThis disparity threatens to exacerbate well-documented racially-biased police practices. Law enforcement databases\u0097including mugshot databases\u0097unjustifiably include a disproportionate number of African Americans, Latinos, and immigrants. An inaccurate system will implicate people for crimes they did not commit, shifting the burden onto innocent people to show they are not who the system mistakenly says they are.\nFace recognition uniquely impacts civil liberties. \n\nIn his majority opinion in the watershed Carpenter v. United States (2018), Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts wrote: \u0093A person does not surrender all Fourth Amendment protection by venturing in the public sphere.\u0094 Yet, government use of face surveillance threatens to do just that. \n\nThis dangerous technology threatens not only Fourth Amendment freedoms of privacy, but also First Amendment freedoms of speech and association. Recently, millions of students took part in a global climate strike calling for environmental justice. Before the recent era of powerful face surveillance technology, there was very little likelihood that the government would identify a protester, and be able to use knowledge of their First Amendment activity to deprive them of future access to employment, housing, or education. With widespread deployment of face surveillance technology, that is no longer the case. In fact, face surveillance has already been used to target people engaged in First Amendment-protected activity. \n\nThe threat to essential liberties extends far beyond political rallies. Images captured outside houses of worship, medical facilities, schools, community centers, or homes could reveal familial, political, religious and sexual partnerships. This threat is heightened by the disturbing record of law enforcement agencies\u0092 failure to securely maintain sensitive personal information they collect about innocent people.

Though you are under great pressure to \"do something\" about crime and I know you all sincerely do want to work toward a safer community, the social price paid by the racial impact and ineffective results of these technologies is TOO HIGH. \n\nPlease vote no to this ordinance (33,808) and continue to support fighting against the racism, economic inequity and all true roots of this crime problem - and support the programs to help families thrive. I know the state is a hindrance to local progressive policies - please use your voice and platforms to find allies across the region and state to allow us to raise wages in all businesses in the city, require paid sick and family leave, fund programs and facilities to better educate and provide recreation to young people. These will bear fruit - those facial recognition and surveillance technologies will bear only trouble at worst - disappointment in wasted resources at best.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJulie Schwam Harris\n\n",

Otherwise, the law abiding good citizens will leave, leaving the criminals behind. \n\nIt appears we have enough dysfunctional management in our criminal justice system from all levels to describe a crises. E.G., from a constrained, debilitated, and weakened police force to low bonds or no bonds by magistrates, to 701 releases, refused charges or reduced charges by the DA, to ineffective sentences or probation by the judiciary. \nThe latest published video of an horrific execution in broad daylight just blocks from the French Quarter and CBD underscores what the condition our current criminal justice system has produced for community safety. \nNew Orleans is worth fighting for and needs renewed support and encouragement of our police department. \nI strongly urge the City Council to restore the use of facial recognition by passing the Surveillance Ordinance at its meeting on July 21. By issuing technology tools back to our NOPD as well as other tools they need we are giving strength back to our men and women in Blue.\nI also request the City Council to review the procedures NOPD uses to collect information on crime that is reported. I have heard and read of several cases where NOPD either refused to come out to crime scenes or refused to take/accept video of the persons in the act of committing the crime. NOPD should use all the information and tools available to capture criminals. Then, of course, the justice system has to either restrain these persons or reform them.\nEnough with the reoccurring crime!!\nNew Orleans government leaders are responsible for protecting its citizens.\nSo, please protect us.\nThank you, \n\nKim Harvey\n109 Lark St\nNew Orleans LA 70124",

We tend to think of technology as being more fair than humans, without being subject to human biases, but these technologies are always built and trained using human data to begin with, so they are actually more likely to perpetuate biases and stereotypes that have existed in the past--and if we aren't given insight into how these technologies are trained and what's being explicitly done to prevent and counteract those historical biases, we should assume that they are incredibly biased.\n\nWithout transparency around these technologies, we also can't trust that our data will be kept safe.

At that time, you determined that flawed and racially biased equipment wasn't keeping anybody safe and were a distraction to the real work of preventing crimes against the public. You were right and periodic upturns and downturns in crime rates, which are generally tied to economic conditions, don't change that accurate analysis. Facial recognition continues to throw innocent Black men and women in jail for crimes they didn't commit because it cannot perform accurately with darker skin tones, predictive policing uses compromised criminal justice data to drive police resources into over-policed neighborhoods again and again to continue to sad story of mass incarceration for low-level offenses, and cell-site simulators sweep up passersby into dragnet digital spying. None of these technologies have any proven effect in crime reduction or crime clearance rates and all have substantial negatives in lack of accuracy, overreach and violations of civil rights. You can meaningfully invest in your community in many more effective ways to reduce crime, enhance policing, and increase work and educational opportunities. We encourage you to support public safety, not dystopian science fiction, which if you read the books, somehow never leads to a safer or more peaceful society. It's a challenging time. It can be tempting to look for easy answers in gadgets, however flawed or racially biased, but if you are committed to genuine outcomes and not performative gestures, then you will not revoke or modify your previous surveillance protections because they were well thought out, correct and in the interests of justice. \n\nSincerely,\n\nTracy Rosenberg\nAdvocacy Director\nOakland Privacy",

The people of New Orleans already decided that we do not want these tools to be used in our city, and that they do not make us feel safer. Passing this ordinance will open up even further the doors of mass incarceration, without actually preventing ANY crime from happening. We do not need more police officers or more surveillance to prevent crime, we need that money to be spent on housing, healthcare, food, NORD, and other youth development programs. Surveillance is not a \"short-term solution\" to our crime surge, this is a tactic to distract from the fact that the city council and mayor have not invested any additional, substantial funds into programs that will actually benefit our community and reduce crime. Additionally, it will open up New Orleans residents to potential surveillance by NOPD's partners, LSP, who have vowed to enforce the state abortion bans. Please, please, for the sake of our residents, our safety, and our privacy, vote no on this ordinance.",
