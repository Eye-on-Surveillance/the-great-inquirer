These technologies are also tied with human rights abuses worldwide. Given the historical landscape of racism in surveillance and social science research, we must NOT allow our city to be a testing ground for these technologies. We must invest in smart, sustainable, PROVEN strategies to improve health and safety. Yes on 33021, but only with a full ban on the four technologies listed.",

We don't need New Orleans to be a testing ground for invasive and racially biased surveillance, as it already has been during a secret predictive policing contract with tech giant Palantir. As a movement sweeps across the country advocating for Black lives and urging us to shift our priorities away from tools and policies that further criminalize our neighbors, it is vital that we respond to this call here in New Orleans and vote YES on Ordinance 33021 as introduced. This ordinance is not taking any tools away as proponents of surveillance might say. It is pumping the brakes and ensuring that we understand the full scope and history of the ways these technologies have been used to seriously harm those already impacted by mass incarceration and the war on working people. It is laying the ground work for a more open and transparent process, and protects citizens from further criminalization and incarceration. This policy brings us one step closer to ensure equity for all citizens. We know there is no 'quick fix' for crime, but we also know that more policing and surveillance does not decrease crime, only increases incarceration. We need a crime prevention policy that addresses the root causes: education, affordable housing, access to good jobs. Surveillance might seem like a quick fix for crime but in fact is a harmful encroachment of the police into the lives of everyday people. Please support this ordinance as introduced, including a ban on new ALPRs, new characteristic tracking, facial recognition, and stingrays. These tools are harmful and invasive. Thank you.",

As you know the ordinance gives the City Council the ability to review all future surveillance technologies adopted by the city as well as putting an outright ban on FACIAL RECOGNITION technology- which is proven to be highly susceptible to error and misidentification, particularly in communities of color and on marginalized citizens. I think we can all agree that giving the City Council, who has the most direct line of communication with the citizens they represent, the ability to closely regulate technology employed against our communities is a wise and prudent choice, which why I am in full support of ORD 33021. I STRONGLY urge you to vote in favor of this bill before it moves to the full city council for a vote on July 16th- where you should again support it. Additionally the watered down language you're seeking is including removing the ban on ALPR's is unacceptable. Pass the Ordinance as it's written. STOP endlessly disappointing your citizens for profit.",

I can\u0092t believe that the current city attorney would allow such poorly drafted legislation to stand, knowing that this is an indefensible government overreach without any justification that flies in the face of established legal precedence. \n\nThis standard does not require probable cause or sign off from a judge. It does not even require a law enforcement officer to execute it, but any city employee. This ordinance is immediately ripe for abuse. There is no oversight mechanism on who, how, when, and where this technology can be used and absolutely no limits on the type of technology to be used. Additionally, there is no restriction on what can be done with the information once it is obtained. \n\nThe people of New Orleans asked to be safer. They have asked for the police to do their job without harming the individuals of this city, a task they have regularly failed at, as they do not prevent, stop, or solve most crimes in this city. And the city\u0092s response is to give them more money and more tools to surveil us? We did not ask to live in a surveillance state, we asked to be safe. This does nothing to make us safer and in fact is a wild intrusion on our rights to be free. \n\nImmediately the city is going to invite lawsuits on this matter AND weaken their ability to prosecute cases by having cases thrown out for violations of 4th amendment rights. \n\nThere is no definition of \u0093named\u0094, there\u0092s not even a definition of \u0093suspect\u0094 and you want us to give every employee of this city the ability to access private information about its citizens without any formal oversight? Absolutely not. I would oppose this ordinance under the best of circumstances and you have not provided a single good circumstance. \n\nI have serious questions about data related to these intrusive violations of our right to privacy and how it will be stored, who will have access to this information, what will be done to keep the information private, and what should happen should this data be used against someone in a manner not foreseen, which is incredibly likely given the broad applicability of this ordinance. \n\nAdditionally, in a city that already over-policies it\u0092s communities of color, facial recognition data will most assuredly only further exacerbate this issue and has been shown to be racist. \n\nIt would behoove the city council to remember that their fiduciary obligation is to all citizens of this city, not just the vocal minority that unjustifiably believe they are in danger of violent crime, when even the recent uptick in that area is poorly framed and illusory. You have a duty to those that may be accused of a crime as well and to protect their best interests (which considering relatives of council members are under FBI investigation should not be a stretch of the imagination\u0085relatives who work for the police department we want to expand rights to). That means that this proposed ordinance, which only further serves to disenfranchise people who are already constantly disenfranchised, should be immediately thrown out.\n\nI urge the city council to oppose passing this ordinance. And if you choose to implement this, I look forward to watching the ACLU or other organization absolutely shred you apart for this. \n\n",

We need to work on building communities of trust together. You, as our elected officals, are endangering that trust by backtracking on hard won resistance against criminalization and surveillance culture. Food, gas, and housing prices are at an all time high. Workers' rights in this city are atrocious. Public transport needs so much more investment. Creating and maintaining jobs that pay a living wage is essential. If you actually focus on service to the people in these ways, they will not need to engage in violent and harmful behaviors. Please refocus with intention. We all know that criminalization and surveillance hurt our Black community members the most. We will not accept this status quo.\n\nWe all want to feel safe in our city, but Ord. 33639 is a step in the wrong direction. I write to you to say in the strongest possible terms that surveillance does not equal safety. In fact, given the racist history of surveillance and the current racial biases built into surveillance technologies, the city\u0092s use of surveillance technologies to monitor and control its residents actually decreases safety for Black and brown New Orleanians and erodes public trust in a government meant to protect us all. The City Council made the right move in December 2020 with the passage of Ord 33021. Please say NO to Ord. 33639.\n\nBefore giving NOPD free reign to use New Orleans as a testing ground for wasteful and racist technology, we need comprehensive civil liberty protections in place and transparent reporting on the use of technology. The money spent purchasing and acquiring new surveillance technologies could be used instead to address the root problems of crime: funding affordable housing, job training programs, revamping the RTA, and freedom from criminalization.\n\nAs your constituent, I urge you to vote NO on Ord. 33639.",

Stop trying to sneak turning New Orleans into a surveillance state past your constituency! It's gross and a wild misuse of your power!:\n\nImplementing the proposed ordinance, giving broad discretion to \u0093any city official\u0094 to use surveillance technology to \u0093locate a named suspect\u0094 is poorly drafted, poorly thought out legislation that is inviting a lawsuit on a number of grounds, starting with the 4th Amendment right to be free of unreasonable search and seizure. \n\nLawsuits that will further tax city resources to defend. I can\u0092t believe, as a former assistant city attorney, that the current city attorney and their staff would allow such poorly drafted legislation to stand as a council item, knowing that this is an indefensible government overreach without any justification that flies in the face of established legal precedence. \n\nThis standard does not require probable cause or sign off from a judge. It does not even require a law enforcement officer to execute it, but any city employee. This ordinance is immediately ripe for abuse. There is no oversight mechanism on who, how, when, and where this technology can be used and absolutely no limits on the type of technology to be used. Additionally, there is no restriction on what can be done with the information once it is obtained. \n\nThe people of New Orleans asked to be safer. They have asked for the police to do their job without harming the individuals of this city, a task they have regularly failed at, as they do not prevent, stop, or solve most crimes in this city. And the city\u0092s response is to give them more money and more tools to surveil us? We did not ask to live in a surveillance state, we asked to be safe. This does nothing to make us safer and in fact is a wild intrusion on our rights to be free. \n\nThere is no definition of \u0093named\u0094, there\u0092s not even a definition of \u0093suspect\u0094 and you want us to give every employee of this city the ability to access private information about its citizens without any formal oversight? Absolutely not. I would oppose this ordinance under the best of circumstances and you have not provided a single good circumstance. \n\nI have serious questions about data related to these intrusive violations of our right to privacy and how it will be stored, who will have access to this information, what will be done to keep the information private, and what should happen should this data be used against someone in a manner not foreseen, which is incredibly likely given the broad applicability of this ordinance. \n\nAdditionally, in a city that already over-policies its communities of color, facial recognition data will most assuredly only further exacerbate this issue and has been shown to be racist. \n\nThis is an absolute overstep by the city under the guise of keeping people safe, when it will actually make us less safe from government invasion into our lives. I do not consent to be surveilled in this manner, I do not consent to having any members of my community surveilled in this manner. I reject the idea that providing an already over-funded police department with more tools for them to abuse keeps us safe in any way. \n\nIt would behoove the city council to remember that their fiduciary obligation is to all citizens of this city, not just the vocal minority that unjustifiably believes they are in danger of violent crime when even the recent uptick in that area is poorly framed and illusory. You have a duty to those that may be accused of a crime as well and to protect their best interests. That means that this proposed ordinance, which only further serves to disenfranchised, should be immediately thrown out.",

That's what this rollback is about \u0096 it is both materially and ideologically about opposing the movement for Black and brown lives that came together in 2020 to say \"no,\" resoundingly, to policing, police brutality, and the murder of Black and brown people at the hands of police, that incarceration and punishment are not the answers to violence.\n\nThis is Racist Technology TM, that has been proven by data scientists to misidentify Black and brown people and WOMEN at rates far higher than white people and men. Even Chief Ferguson knows this and has noted in public that there are concerns there! A 2019 Study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology found that face recognition algorithms CATEGORICALLY do not perform as well when examining the faces of women and people of color. The people of this city already know the poor performance of our city's other technology \u0096 just look at how the Sewerage and Water Board overcharges people regularly! Now they're asking us to trust that this technology that has proven anti-Black, anti-Women bias will work perfectly? That's not acceptable. That doesn't keep us safe.\n\nTo that end, the only thing besides RACIAL PROFILING that this technology does is WASTE OUR CITY'S RESOURCES on profit-driven corporations, using this city's coffers as their own personal piggy bank.

I am writing today to voice our opposition to Ord. 33,639.\n\nOne of the primary functions of NOVAS is to hold stakeholders accountable to their commitment to safely reduce the jail population here in New Orleans. In order to hold stakeholders accountable to policy, we have to know what those policies are, and what tools they have at their disposal to enforce them. Prior to the passage of the ordinance banning this technology in 2020, members of the community were assured that no ban was necessary, because law enforcement was not using these harmful surveillance technologies anyway. Come to find out, NOPD had been secretly using facial recognition software through its partnership with Louisiana State Police (who are currently under federal investigation by the DOJ for use of excessive force and racially biased policing). This lack of transparency confirms that we need safeguards in place to protect the public from racially biased and harmful policing.\n\nWe also know these technologies have been historically weaponized to target Black and brown communities, and that facial recognition algorithms are more likely to mis-identify non-white faces. In a city where 86% of the jail population is Black (compared to 60% of the general population), we should be looking for ways to reduce ethnic and racial disparities in our criminal legal system. This ordinance would be a step in the wrong direction.\n\nFinally, there is no evidence that additional surveillance does anything to prevent or reduce crime. We are in agreement that all New Orleanians deserve to feel safe in their own city, but safety does NOT come from additional policing or surveillance measures. We ask that you instead invest in long-term solutions such as affordable and available housing, employment opportunities and fair wages, childcare and education, and other programs that deter crime from occurring in the first place.

Face surveillance technology can only be used in very specific situations and evidence obtained from face surveillance alone shall not be sufficient to establish probable cause for the purpose of effectuating an arrest. \n\nIn addition, there must be appropriate training and frequent model validation to ensure effective and appropriate use of this technology. Appropriate training and model validation are necessary to prevent the unfair or inaccurate profiling of people of color. Safeguards are appropriate to ensure everyone is treated fairly.\n\nI understand that there is no \"singular answer\" to the violent crime surge occurring in this City.

Crime is loosely defined as \"an action or omission that constitutes an offense.\" As we attempt to push along and through year three of the COVID-19 pandemic, crime is the historic levels of unemployment our residents face. Crime is the lack of affordable housing due to the continual inundation of Air B&Bs. Crime is the food insecurity that leads to dozens upon dozens of cars parked hours in advance outside of weekly Culture Aid NOLA food distribution sites, crime is the repeated closing of schools and lapse in education that our youth experience due to an ineffective charter system.\n\nAll of these things and so much more could begin to be solved by the money that continues to be pumped into the city's surveillance apparatus and police department.

Given the totality of evidence of over a century of NOPD corruption, abuse & their inability to make our communities safer, it seems negligent to once again consider giving them more access to tools & technologies that are frankly dangerous. Especially in a moment when there is a clear, demonstrated need across so many basic aspects of life for New Orleanians: affordable housing, healthcare, utility bills, debt, un-liveable wages, trauma from hurricanes & pandemics. Simultaneously there is overwhelming evidence across multiple research sectors showing that violence is prevented most effectively by meeting these needs. And there is overwhelming public awareness and support for alternatives to policing, for community investment and policies that will immediately alleviate widespread, preventable suffering. You consider this ordinance as we can all look at an uncertain near future- so close we can feel it- in which fascist, authoritarian governments use the power of ubiquitous surveillance to repress political dissent, free expression, or even to spy on and target entire communities with genocidal intent. Even now, we face a present moment filled with fear about where people can access healthcare like abortion, or children will be able to learn about or talk about in school, or whether trans people will be allowed to exist in Louisiana. You cannot promise us safety, accountability or oversight with these tools. You can\u0092t. And even if you could, this is not what we want and this will not make us any safer. Lastly, seeing as how the council has previously sought to investigate the Mayor\u0092s office contract process under the Smart City\u0092s initiative, it seems odd that this council would not pursue a serious investigation of the allegations of misconduct pertaining to the so-called \u0093NOLA Coalition\u0092s\u0094 involvement in publicly pushing for this ordinance. Specifically the role of GNO Inc. and its key partners who have allegedly engaged in widespread manipulation, misinformation and the inappropriate use of private funds to coerce the participation of community organizations. A group pushing for technologies that would- at minimum- require deep & sustained levels of trust, transparency & oversight, should not be engaged in back room dealing, adding coalition members without knowledge or consent, or flying to Israel to meet with surveillance tech companies that currently contract with JPSO. Especially when key the people involved have a documented history of enabling and participating in Palantir\u0092s secretive and potentially unconstitutional \u0093predictive policing\u0094 program in New Orleans- especially those formerly employed by the Mayor. This fact alone should give this council great pause. People\u0092s lives are on the line. There is no good version of this ordinance. We deserve so much better.",

These systems can be used to identify people in photos, videos, or in real-time. However, face recognition software is notoriously bad at recognizing women, young people, African Americans, and other ethnic minorities, often misidentifying them. \n\nThis disparity threatens to exacerbate well-documented racially-biased police practices. Law enforcement databases\u0097including mugshot databases\u0097unjustifiably include a disproportionate number of African Americans, Latinos, and immigrants. An inaccurate system will implicate people for crimes they did not commit, shifting the burden onto innocent people to show they are not who the system mistakenly says they are.\nFace recognition uniquely impacts civil liberties. \n\nIn his majority opinion in the watershed Carpenter v. United States (2018), Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts wrote: \u0093A person does not surrender all Fourth Amendment protection by venturing in the public sphere.\u0094 Yet, government use of face surveillance threatens to do just that. \n\nThis dangerous technology threatens not only Fourth Amendment freedoms of privacy, but also First Amendment freedoms of speech and association. Recently, millions of students took part in a global climate strike calling for environmental justice. Before the recent era of powerful face surveillance technology, there was very little likelihood that the government would identify a protester, and be able to use knowledge of their First Amendment activity to deprive them of future access to employment, housing, or education. With widespread deployment of face surveillance technology, that is no longer the case. In fact, face surveillance has already been used to target people engaged in First Amendment-protected activity. \n\nThe threat to essential liberties extends far beyond political rallies. Images captured outside houses of worship, medical facilities, schools, community centers, or homes could reveal familial, political, religious and sexual partnerships. This threat is heightened by the disturbing record of law enforcement agencies\u0092 failure to securely maintain sensitive personal information they collect about innocent people.

That is the first reason that A Community Voice objects to the new surveillance purchase that it is yet another decoy for real police work when there is next to no community patrols in Black neighborhoods, and yet plenty of widespread shootouts and murders? Why is there such a dodge on properly handling 101 community policing? Yet, spending money for new contracts is an addiction.\n\nWe have 3x the average number of pregnant women murdered here and I daresay they are all Black, but no one seems to be naming out this situation or investigating this. Buy some software and it won't fix that.\n\nFacial recognition has been rejected by other cities* because it is ineffective and discriminates primarily against Black women, the largest single population constituency of our city. Why would you vote for something that so many fine entities show that consistently discriminates against Black women?\n\nWe agree and support those who are studying surveillance and the impact on civil rights at Eye on Surveillance: Before giving NOPD free reign to use New Orleans as a testing ground for wasteful and racist technology, we need comprehensive civil liberty protections in place and transparent reporting on the use of technology. The money spent purchasing and acquiring new surveillance technologies could be used instead to address the root problems of crime: funding affordable housing, job training programs, revamping the RTA, and freedom from criminalization.\n\nAs your constituents, we urge you to address crime through actual effective measures, and use these funds to do so.

Never forget none were armed or had committed any crime.\n\nNever forget homicide detective Arthur \"Archie\" Kaufman, who was found guilty of conspiring with the defendants to conceal evidence in order to make the shootings appear justified, including fabricating information for his official reports on the case.

At that time, you determined that flawed and racially biased equipment wasn't keeping anybody safe and were a distraction to the real work of preventing crimes against the public. You were right and periodic upturns and downturns in crime rates, which are generally tied to economic conditions, don't change that accurate analysis. Facial recognition continues to throw innocent Black men and women in jail for crimes they didn't commit because it cannot perform accurately with darker skin tones, predictive policing uses compromised criminal justice data to drive police resources into over-policed neighborhoods again and again to continue to sad story of mass incarceration for low-level offenses, and cell-site simulators sweep up passersby into dragnet digital spying. None of these technologies have any proven effect in crime reduction or crime clearance rates and all have substantial negatives in lack of accuracy, overreach and violations of civil rights. You can meaningfully invest in your community in many more effective ways to reduce crime, enhance policing, and increase work and educational opportunities. We encourage you to support public safety, not dystopian science fiction, which if you read the books, somehow never leads to a safer or more peaceful society. It's a challenging time. It can be tempting to look for easy answers in gadgets, however flawed or racially biased, but if you are committed to genuine outcomes and not performative gestures, then you will not revoke or modify your previous surveillance protections because they were well thought out, correct and in the interests of justice. \n\nSincerely,\n\nTracy Rosenberg\nAdvocacy Director\nOakland Privacy",
