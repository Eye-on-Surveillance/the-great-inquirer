But it also notes that there is time for a course correction given the huge sums yet to be spent.\nA growing surplus\nWhen the pandemic walloped the city\u2019s tourism industry in 2020, the Cantrell administration prepared for a downturn in sales and hotel taxes for years to come. The city planned employee furloughs in 2021 that would save $26 million, plus another $92 million in general budget cuts, according to the BGR report.\nHowever, in March 2021, the U.S. Congress passed into law the American Rescue Plan Act, which was designed to provide a lifeline to local governments. Suddenly, New Orleans was in line to receive $388 million in federal funds in two installments.\nThe federal law placed some limits on how local governments could spend the money. The city plugged $187 million from the first installment into the police and fire departments, freeing up general fund dollars that would have been spent there as the city saw fit.\nThat didn\u2019t violate federal law. But the fact that the city only explained how it was using the money on the front end in an online dashboard, the Bureau of Governmental Research said, \u201cdoes not provide the public with the information necessary to understand ARPA\u2019s real impact on funding for other departments or the city\u2019s finances.\"\nMayor LaToya Cantrell answers questions during the Community Budget Meeting at Lakeview Christian Center in New Orleans, Thursday, Aug. 18, 2022.

Hundreds of unfilled positions, many in the New Orleans Police Department, contributed to a huge balance of leftover funds at the end of 2021. In total, the city spent $532 million in 2021, $100 million short of its trimmed-down budget.\nThe BGR report found that even without the federal funds, last year the city would have been able to meet all of its expenses while generating a $25 million surplus. In effect, the federal relief dollars helped grow the city's fund balance.\nThe Cantrell administration has portrayed its conservative budgeting as a prudent response to the uncertainty of the pandemic. Even after Congress passed ARPA it warned of budget shortfalls lasting into 2025. It has also said that the savings have allowed it to sock money into a much-needed rainy-day fund. Yet the drop in spending coincided with widespread complaints about the quality of municipal services.\nRebecca Mowbray, the president and CEO of BGR, said the group didn\u2019t try to determine how the two factors were related.\n\u201cOur task here really was just to follow the money and see where it went. We didn\u2019t so much make judgments about how they were spending it,\u201d she said.\nSpending the pot\nThis summer, the federal government sent the city its second, $194 million block of pandemic relief funds. Heading into the November budget season, Cantrell held a series of town halls.\nIn some settings, Cantrell didn't typically distinguish between sources of funds and the timing of City Council votes. But administration officials also stated that the city would allocate general funds through the ordinary budget process before turning to the federal dollars.\nInstead, the Cantrell administration and the City Council passed the last-minute amendments to the mayor\u2019s proposed budget that caught organizers off-guard. Those amendments allocated $124 million in ARPA funds and $151 million in fund balance dollars, according to BGR.\n\u201cUltimately, they went ahead and passed everything all at once, not really giving citizens the opportunity to know the details,\u201d said Susie Dudis, a BGR research analyst.\nIn a statement, a city spokesperson pushed back at the idea that there wasn\u2019t advance notice, pointing to the town halls and budget hearings. John Lawson, the spokesperson, said the amendment included priorities that had emerged as consensus priorities, like fighting crime and blight.\n\u201cThe first set of appropriations invested in projects and initiatives in response to what we heard from the public as core/vital basic needs,\u201d said Lawson.\nGilbert Monta\u00f1o, bottom center, chief administrative officer for New Orleans, talks about the details of Mayor LaToya Cantrell's 2023 operating budget to the New Orleans City Council on Tuesday, October 25, 2022 at City Hall.

But even with that added level of detail, BGR\u2019s report faulted the administration for falling short on transparency.\nA $5 million outlay for \u201cunhoused populations,\u201d for example, was described in an internal memo as going to a \u201cfull-time staff member and consulting team to develop a comprehensive program to support unhoused populations in the city.\u201d\nThe BGR, Dudis said, is \u201choping we will see more of the actual plan details... their time frame, what are the objectives, what is the population of people being served. That, we don\u2019t have at this point.\u201d\nMoney in the bank\nDistrict A Council member Joe Giarrusso, the chair of the City Council budget committee, agreed with the Cantrell administration that the budget amendments reflected a broad consensus. But he also agreed with BGR that the city and council could have done a better job of communicating how they planned to allocate ARPA funds.\nThe issues raised in the BGR report, he said, pointed to the larger problem of compressing complex budget discussions into November. He favors expanding budget season to include October.\nGiarrusso said he expects to hold hearings on how to spend the remainder of one-time dollars from ARPA and the fund balance in January and February. That amounts to about $70 million in federal dollars plus at least as many fund-balance dollars, he\u2019s said previously.\nCiardullo and other activists are pushing for the city to spend the money on a wide variety of needs. His group\u2019s priority is up to $90 million to tackle what he called \u201ca tremendous shortage of affordable rental housing.\u201d\nGiarrusso said that under a new approach he is pioneering next year, there will also be quarterly hearings on how the city is spending its money. The Cantrell administration said that it will also be expanding an online dashboard in early 2023 to include spending outcomes and the use of fund balance dollars.\nEmail Matt Sledge at msledge@theadvocate.com.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nPrint\nCopy article link\nSave\nThis Day in History\nSponsored by Connatix\nRecommended for you\nRecommended by\nSECTIONS\nHOME\nNEWS\nOPINION\nSPORTS\nENTERTAINMENT/LIFE\nNEWSLETTERS\nGAMES\nSERVICES\nCLASSIFIEDS\nSEARCH\nSUBSCRIBE | GROUPS\nDIGITAL ADVERTISING\nHELP/CONTACT US\nRSS FEEDS\nMEDIA KIT\nEEDITION\nCAREERS\nTEACHER'S LINK\nREVIEWING THE RECORD\nOUR SITES\nOBITUARIES\nJOBS\nCELEBRATIONS\nNIE\nCLASSIFIEDS\nHOMES\nPETS\nARCHIVES\nSTORE\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nnola.com\n840 St. Charles Avenue\nNew Orleans, LA 70130\nPhone: 504-529-0522\n\nNews Tips:\nnolanewstips@theadvocate.com\nOther questions:\nsubscriberservices@theadvocate.com\nNeed help?\nReport a delivery issue\nCreate a temporary stop\nSign up for recurring payments\nPay your bill\nUpdate your billing info\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2023 NOLA.com 840 St. Charles Avenue, New Orleans, LA  | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy\nPowered by BLOX Content Management System from BLOX Digital.\nThis website stores data such as cookies to enable essential website functionality, marketing, personalization and analytics.
