This month, she took a run at elected politics, finishing fourth in a race to unseat U.S. Sen. John Kennedy, who won handily.\nSteib is also a program model. Imprisoned as a teen after pleading guilty to participating in a burglary and arson in Texas, she served more than nine years and then yearned to become a doctor.\nDenied acceptance to the University of New Orleans, she removed the check mark from the box, reapplied and got in. Steib went on to a laboratory science degree at LSU\u2019s Health Sciences Center, working at Ochsner and other hospitals before shifting to advocacy.\n\u201cThe hoops that we have to jump through to make people think you are valuable, you are important, to make people take a chance on you \u2026 and it\u2019s all based on this conviction,\u201d Steib said.\nInstructor Pearl Thompson teaches participants of Operation Restoration how to test urine with chem strips at the New Orleans Career Center in New Orleans, Monday, Oct. 3, 2022.

And then it\u2019s like, hey, the sky's the limit.\u201d\nThe nascent program is among a smattering devoted to smoothing the path to reentry for women prisoners in Louisiana, who comprise a small minority of the inmate population but can face crushing barriers. \nKamisha Redmond and Mykelle Dawson work together to read a chem strip used to test urine at the New Orleans Career Center in New Orleans, Monday, Oct. 3, 2022.

Half of women prisoners are in for drug or property crimes.\nDomestic or sexual violence factor into the histories of many women prisoners, two-thirds of whom have a history of mental health problems.\nA state task force on women\u2019s incarceration issued a 2020 report that also found a rate of post-traumatic stress disorder three times higher for imprisoned women than men. Most women prisoners have minor children.\nSteib sat on the state task force, which also found few transitional work programs focused on women prisoners.\nRotanya Fair and Mykelle Dawson go over a quiz results at the New Orleans Career Center in New Orleans, Monday, Oct. 3, 2022.

Add to that a woman who has a serious and persistent mental health issue, and we have a real recipe for hardship. She\u2019s going on the street already 10 steps behind.\u201d\nA state corrections spokesman said the COVID-19 pandemic shelved plans for the agency to team with Operation Restoration to create a lab training program within the women\u2019s prison in St. Gabriel. Spokesman Ken Pastorick said talks to resurrect that plan are starting up.\nIn the meantime, Operation Restoration currently offers a bachelor's program in partnership with Tulane University to women prisoners. Pastorick pointed to literacy, cosmetology, horticulture and other programs available to them, while noting limitations.\nFlooding of the women's prison six years ago left corrections officials to divide those prisoners among state and local facilities. Prison officials have promised expanded programs for women with a new $146 million facility due to open in late 2024.\nDewey praised Louisiana officials for their efforts, while highlighting \u201cenormous\u201d challenges for women exiting prison, including stigma.\n\u201cThe expectation is women will always be the caregivers and that women who have struggled with addiction somehow are bad mothers choosing drugs over their children,\u201d Dewey said, \u201cnot recognizing the fact the majority of women have been victims of trauma.\u201d\nWelch described a history of abuse before a habit of stealing credit cards led to guilty pleas to 11 felony counts and a lengthy prison term as a habitual offender.\nKamisha Redmond and Mykelle Dawson work together to read a chem strip used to test urine at the New Orleans Career Center in New Orleans, Monday, Oct. 3, 2022.

In 1999, Welch said, her ex-husband \u201cleft me for dead\u201d in Harvey after she threatened to leave.\n\u201cHe drug me into that house and beat me in different areas,\u201d she said. \u201cI deal with the pain almost every day, with the swelling.\u201d\nIf anything, she said, prison taught her persistence.\n\u201cIt\u2019s your past, but it still haunts you sometimes,\u201d she said. \u201cI know I didn\u2019t survive through this life of being abused, misused and everything just to be thrown to the trash. And I want to make something of myself.\u201d\nA mother and daughter duo have been among the students enrolled since the first lab training class rolled out in April.\nAbrais Nedd, 37, described a hectic life as she settled behind a table at the front of the class recently. She gave birth this year while locked up in the St. Tammany Parish jail, she said, and for months tried to bond with her infant son in Zoom calls.\nNedd said she landed in a mental health institution before her recent criminal trouble but was now living in a New Orleans shelter and arranging visits with her baby, who is now in foster care. A felony charge looms for obstruction of justice, an allegation she denies but can't shake.\n\u201cWhen I found out about this (program), I thought it was maybe something I could do to earn a living where my background may not be a factor,\u201d she said.\nThrough grants, Operation Restoration also provides laptops, child care, rides and other support to help recently incarcerated women land on their feet.\nThe third class for lab assistant training graduated 14 women, including Nedd and Welch, though the successes so far in securing jobs and licenses for graduates has been lean.\nAt least two women have gained jobs through the program since the first class in April, one at a local hospital and the other in a private lab, said the instructors.\nThe licensing includes a background check and can take six months. So far, none of the women in the program has gained a license from the state Board of Medical Examiners.\nDr. Vincent Culotta, executive director for the board, said a criminal conviction may not disqualify an applicant, though each is investigated for a decision to approve, deny, or attach probation to a license. He said the board has helped Operation Restoration with the application process, including creating a system to let it pay the fees for students in the training. \nAs she praised the organization\u2019s housing director, Dolfinette Martin, for taking an interest, Nedd suggested there's more to the training program than a license. \n\u201cEverything that I\u2019m going through, she\u2019s been teaching me I can trust again,\u201d said Nedd, \u201cthat everybody is not going to hurt me. That they\u2019re here to help me.\u201d\nInvestigative reporting is more essential than ever, which is why we\u2019ve established the Louisiana Investigative Journalism Fund, a non-profit supported by our readers.\n\nTo learn more, please click here.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nPrint\nCopy article link\nSave\nSECTIONS\nHOME\nNEWS\nOPINION\nSPORTS\nENTERTAINMENT/LIFE\nNEWSLETTERS\nGAMES\nSERVICES\nCLASSIFIEDS\nSEARCH\nSUBSCRIBE | GROUPS\nDIGITAL ADVERTISING\nHELP/CONTACT US\nRSS FEEDS\nMEDIA KIT\nEEDITION\nCAREERS\nTEACHER'S LINK\nREVIEWING THE RECORD\nOUR SITES\nOBITUARIES\nJOBS\nCELEBRATIONS\nNIE\nCLASSIFIEDS\nHOMES\nPETS\nARCHIVES\nSTORE\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nnola.com\n840 St. Charles Avenue\nNew Orleans, LA 70130\nPhone: 504-529-0522\n\nNews Tips:\nnolanewstips@theadvocate.com\nOther questions:\nsubscriberservices@theadvocate.com\nNeed help?\nReport a delivery issue\nCreate a temporary stop\nSign up for recurring payments\nPay your bill\nUpdate your billing info\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2023 NOLA.com 840 St. Charles Avenue, New Orleans, LA  | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy\nPowered by BLOX Content Management System from BLOX Digital.\nThis website stores data such as cookies to enable essential website functionality, marketing, personalization and analytics.
