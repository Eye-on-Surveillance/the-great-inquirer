(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)\nNEW ORLEANS \u2014 You don\u2019t need to be an expert to know energy costs in New Orleans are rising. Spend enough time at your closest grocery or dive bar and you\u2019ll soon hear neighbors expressing shock at their latest Entergy bills.\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s feeling it,\u201d said Logan Burke, executive director of the New Orleans-based Alliance for Affordable Energy.\nEntergy officials have continued to claim the company offers \u201csome of the lowest electricity rates in the nation,\u201d and blamed the recent sticker shock on gas prices and higher customer energy use during heat waves and winter storms.\nBut the data tells another story.\nVerite compiled 20 years of Entergy New Orleans\u2019 electric and gas rates, finding that energy bills are rising at the fastest pace in nearly two decades, even for customers who kept their energy usage exactly the same.\nThe average New Orleans resident in 2019 paid $1,345 for a year of electricity, or about $112 per month. In 2022, that same customer using the same exact amount of electricity would pay $2,148, or $179 per month \u2014 a 60% increase, Verite\u2019s analysis found. If you add gas charges, average monthly bills rose from $135 to $215.\nBills will would rise even higher if the New Orleans City Council approves Entergy\u2019s controversial $1.3 billion proposal for storm resilience upgrades, which calls for another 20% bill hike over the next decade.\nSources: Entergy New Orleans customer bills, sample bills produced by Entergy and regulatory filings with the city council. Charges were calculated based on 2019 average monthly residential electric and gas usage, according to data from the federal Energy Information Agency. Verite then applied the 2019 consumption to ENO\u2019s rates from 2004 through October 2023. For months where data on variable charges, such as fuel costs, were not available, Verite filled in average rates from surrounding years. See the underlying data.\n\u201cIt looks like a runaway charge, and there\u2019s no end in sight,\u201d Monique Harden, an advocate with the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, told Verite.\nCosts are growing for a number of reasons, according to council officials, including new storm fees, fuel costs, new power plants, electric reliability upgrades, inflation and an overhaul of the city\u2019s gas infrastructure.\nBut those costs don\u2019t account for the entire bill increase, Verite\u2019s analysis found. And some local affordable-energy advocates are calling for the New Orleans City Council, which regulates Entergy New Orleans, to audit how the company is spending customer money.\nThe rise in New Orleans\u2019 bills also appears to be outpacing the rest of the country. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that Entergy New Orleans\u2019 price per kilowatt hour \u2014 the standard unit of measure for electricity \u2014 has risen by 40% since 2020. That\u2019s twice the national average for the same period.\nThe federal data also shows that the average energy costs paid by New Orleans residents was 7% below the national average in April 2020, but rose to 7% above the average in April 2023.\nThe rising bills have an outsized impact in a city like New Orleans, where typical household incomes lag behind much of the rest of the country.\n\u201cWe\u2019re a poor city and Louisiana is a very poor state,\u201d Harden said. \u201cSo we have a lot of folks living paycheck to paycheck, or even in more dire situations. For lots of people, an average Entergy bill is already going to be a challenge.\u201d\nThe energy burden \u2014 the percentage of income used to pay energy bills \u2014 is now 70% higher for a median income New Orleans household than the US average, according to the federal data.\nEntergy New Orleans officials have repeatedly declined to say how many customers have fallen behind on bills in recent years, but told the City Council late last year that 38,000 customers \u2014 roughly one in five New Orleans accounts \u2014 had entered payment plans to pay off bill debt. Officials last month said that customers owed nearly $7 million in past-due gas and electric bills.\nThe company did not respond to any of Verite\u2019s findings or answer questions. In a brief statement, Entergy New Orleans spokesman Beau Tidwell acknowledged that there had been \u201cincreased costs for many customers,\u201d but maintained it was largely out of the company\u2019s control.\n\u201cThe last two summers have seen record levels of heat, and last summer natural gas prices were very high,\u201d Tidwell said. \u201cBoth elements contributed to increased costs for customers, and while they were outside of our control, we are sensitive to the impact they created.\u201d\nNot everyone agrees with that assessment. Councilwoman Helena Moreno told Verite that she also blamed costs from the construction of the New Orleans Power Station, Entergy\u2019s controversial gas plant in New Orleans East, which went online in 2020.\nMoreno came into office shortly after the council voted to approve the plant in 2018 and unsuccessfully attempted to stop its construction after she took office.\nMoreno told Verite this week that she is considering whether to force Entergy to sell the plant, which would let customers off the hook for paying off its $210 million construction cost, as well as roughly $450 million the company is allowed to collect for interest payments, operations and profit.\n\u201cI believe an option to eliminate the cost of NOPS from ratepayers bills should be examined,\u201d Moreno said.\nBut the gas plant only accounts for a small part of local bill increases (roughly $6.96 per month, according to information provided by the council\u2019s utility consultants). Some Entergy critics argue that there is also a broader and more simple reason bills are rising so fast \u2014 Entergy is favoring its shareholders over its customers.\n\u201cEntergy\u2019s mission is to enrich shareholders, so it\u2019s a contributing factor for certain,\u201d Harden said. \u201cIt\u2019s about trapping New Orleans residents to ensure we\u2019re always paying high bills, a cycle of billing we have no control over.\u201d\nSource on dividend payments: Entergy Corp. public reports.  Graph compares Entergy Corp.\u2019s total shareholder dividend payouts on a 12-month rolling basis vs. monthly Entergy New Orleans bills for an average residential electric and gas customer. Average monthly bills were calculated using average ENO residential monthly 2019 gas and electric consumption, according to data from the federal Energy Information Agency. See the underlying data.\nAt the same time as bills have reached historic highs, so have dividend payments to Entergy shareholders. Entergy New Orleans\u2019 parent company, Entergy Corp., has paid out $3.2 billion in shareholder dividends since 2020.\nBurke and other advocates have long warned that the company has effectively shifted most of the risk of the business onto the shoulders of customers, who have to deal with erratic bills while shareholders enjoy steady, rising profits.\n\u201cWhy should only residents be the ones who suffer as a result of climate change and international markets?\u201d Burke said. \u201cWhy should people, especially in cities like New Orleans where a vast percentage of our population is in poverty, be holding up these Fortune 500 companies and their shareholders who are insulated from every risk at every turn? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any world in which that is just or equitable.\u201d\nA historic rise\nThe only time New Orleans has seen a similar spike in energy bills over the last 20 years was in 2006, the year after hurricane Katrina, when Entergy New Orleans was facing serious trouble.\nSources: Entergy New Orleans customer bills, sample bills produced by Entergy and regulatory filings with the City Council. Charges were calculated based on 2019 average monthly residential electric and gas usage, according to data from the federal Energy Information Agency. Verite then applied the 2019 consumption to ENO\u2019s rates from 2004 through October 2023. For months where data on variable charges, such as fuel costs, were not available, Verite filled in average rates from surrounding years. See the underlying data.\nEntergy New Orleans was in the hole for over half a billion dollars in damage caused during and after the storm. And because of the massive displacement of New Orleans residents, the company\u2019s customer base was cut in half, leading to a sharp revenue decline. The company even filed for bankruptcy.\nThe bill increase over the last few years hasn\u2019t been quite as steep as in the years following Katrina. But as Burke pointed out, the company isn\u2019t facing nearly the same challenges now. In fact, just this week the company announced it was raising shareholder dividends by another six percent.\n\u201cI mean, we were dealing with bankruptcy following Katrina,\u201d Burke said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not where we are now. It\u2019s a different situation entirely. Is the company in dire straits? It doesn\u2019t look like it. It seems as though the company is continuing to deliver dividends and continuing to benefit shareholders.\u201d\nEntergy\u2019s rising bills come at a tough time for residents, who have faced a barrage of financial burdens in recent years \u2014 including rising housing costs and insurance rates, hurricane damage, inflation and the COVID pandemic \u2014 that have made it increasingly difficult to afford life in New Orleans.\nAndreanecia Morris, executive director of affordable housing group HousingNOLA, said local government officials have \u201cfailed\u201d to properly respond to rising utility bills, which she said are a major contributor to the city\u2019s affordable housing crisis.\n\u201cThe calculations around affordability don\u2019t just include basic housing costs like mortgages and rents \u2014 utilities are also a key part,\u201d Morris said in an email. \u201cThis data shows that the failure to act has direct, and dire, consequences and reinforces the need for policy makers to introduce meaningful reforms that allow folks to keep a roof over their heads and keep the lights on.\u201d\nWhy are bills climbing this time?\nWhen previously questioned about rising prices in recent years by local media or the City Council, Entergy New Orleans has cited two central reasons: higher gas prices and extreme weather.\nHeat waves and winter storms have indeed driven up usage as people try to heat and cool New Orleans\u2019 notoriously energy inefficient homes. And a series of hurricanes have caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage, mainly from Hurricane Ida in 2021.\n\u201cThis is climate change on our bills right now,\u201d Burke said.\nBut those two factors alone don\u2019t explain the recent bill hikes. Verite\u2019s analysis shows that bills rose significantly even for customers who kept their energy consumption constant. And average monthly storm fees make up less than a dollar of the total monthly increase.\nCouncilmember JP Morrell and the council\u2019s utility advisors provided four additional explanations and the monthly bill impact compared to 2019: electric reliability upgrades ($3.96 per month), gas infrastructure investments ($5.52 per month), and the construction of two power plants: the New Orleans Power Station ($6.96 per month) and the New Orleans Solar Station ($1.10 per month).\nThe NOPS plant is a particularly controversial charge. The council approved the gas plant in 2018 after Entergy hired actors to pose as supporters of the proposal at council meetings. Questions have swirled ever since about whether it was financially prudent or provides the hurricane protection that officials originally promised.\n\u201cWe are now captive to a gas plant we didn\u2019t need,\u201d Harden said. \u201cNone of the shifting justifications were ever fulfilled by this gas plant. But now we\u2019re paying it for the next 30 plus years. People who are yet to be born will be paying for this gas plant.\u201d\nAltogether, while the explanations from Entergy and the City Council account for the majority of bill increases since 2019, it doesn\u2019t explain the whole spike. And it isn\u2019t entirely clear what makes up the remaining portion \u2014 about $25 per month for an average customer.\nWhen you break down a bill, the majority of the recent increases don\u2019t come from storm fees or fuel costs, but from the base electric and gas charges, which, like all Entergy charges, are approved by the City Council.\nSources: Entergy New Orleans customer bills, sample bills produced by Entergy and regulatory filings with the city council. Charges were calculated based on 2019 average monthly residential electric and gas usage, according to data from the federal Energy Information Agency. Verite then applied the 2019 consumption to ENO\u2019s rates from 2004 through October 2023. For months where data on variable charges, such as fuel costs, were not available, Verite filled in average rates from surrounding years. See the underlying data.\nUnlike other elements of an Entergy bill, it is difficult to decipher exactly why base energy charges have increased. While fuel charges and storm fees are used for one specific purpose, the base energy charge pays for virtually everything Entergy does, from hiring linemen to buying wire to paying executive bonuses.\nLocal advocates including Burke and Harden say the company\u2019s regulators \u2014 the City Council \u2014 need to dive into Entergy\u2019s books to figure out exactly how customer money is being used, especially before they consider Entergy\u2019s $1.3 billion storm hardening plan.\n\u201cFor every dollar that residents pay to Entergy, what is it being used for exactly?\u201d Harden said. \u201cAnd what are the benefits returning to the residents? It\u2019s really basic.\u201d\nThe City Council questioned Entergy New Orleans\u2019 spending decisions in the wake of Hurricane Ida. The storm caused a city-wide blackout, during which time 21 people died, mostly from extreme heat exposure. The tragedy raised questions about why Entergy\u2019s grid wasn\u2019t more prepared, especially as climate change increases the frequency and intensity of storms.\n\u201cSince Hurricane Katrina, the council has approved requests for funding around storm hardening,\u201d Harden said. \u201cWhere is that? What has that gotten us? Because there hasn\u2019t been any audit or review of that. But each and every time there\u2019s a hurricane, there\u2019s Entergy with its hand out again.\u201d\nThe council voted in late 2021 to launch an internal management audit of Entergy New Orleans to answer the very questions Harden is asking. But the audit never happened. The council put out public bids to hire an independent auditor twice, but no firms applied for the job and the effort lost momentum.\nMorrell, who is chair of the council utility committee, did not respond to questions about whether the council would make another effort to follow through with an audit.\nThe $1.3 billion question\nAs customers struggle with bills, Entergy has launched a public relations campaign to convince residents and the council to get on board with its $1.3 billion plan to harden the grid against future hurricanes.\nThe plan was written at the direction of the council in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida and is linked to an $8 billion storm hardening plan from another Entergy subsidiary \u2014 Entergy Louisiana. The company argues that the investment wouldn\u2019t only keep us safer during storms, but save money in the long run by reducing the damage caused by storms, which customers have to pay to fix.\n\u201cFrom my perspective, there are things within Entergy\u2019s plan that I would argue are no regrets investments,\u201d Burke said.\nAt the same time, many customers are simply at their limit for what they can afford. And Burke and Harden agree that some of the items Entergy is asking customers to pay for, like routine operations and maintenance, are things the company should already be doing with the money they\u2019re collecting from customers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not getting things we\u2019re already paying for,\u201d Harden said.\nBurke added that it\u2019s hard to believe Entergy\u2019s argument that it can\u2019t afford to provide basic, reliable services without bill hikes, while its parent company continues to hand out record-setting dividends to shareholders.\nHowever, Burke said there was reason for optimism, and that after years of advocates sounding the alarm, regulators with the City Council and the Louisiana Public Service Commission are finally starting to seriously question Entergy\u2019s budgeting decisions.\n\u201cRegulators are starting to ask these questions,\u201d Burke said. \u201cWe can only hope these decision makers will address the existing system and make it work for people and not just corporations.\u201d\nThis article first appeared on Verite News and is republished here under a Creative Commons license.\nREPUBLISH\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.
