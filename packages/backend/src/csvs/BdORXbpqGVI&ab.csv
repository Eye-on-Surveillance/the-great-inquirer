26:28:00,this area uh and sees the majority of the violence that comes through the city,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
26:33:00,of New Orleans uh there have been violence and eruption programs at UMC for many years uh and we as the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
26:41:00,providers that are there from LSU Tulane and UMC uh truly believe that there is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
26:47:00,value to these programs and we uh after this year with our community health,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
26:52:00,needs assessment we're at University the public told us that one of their major priorities was the impact of violence on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
27:00:00,health right and while University sees those patients and we get them through the trauma of that we really want to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
27:07:00,find ways that we can also enter being uh and and deal with the violence uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

27:18:00,can help to bring people to the table to mitigate and go out and hopefully interrupt what's happening,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
27:25:00,um we thought that the potential to help oversee this program and build out this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
27:31:00,program through UMC with uh consistent training uh that reaches and touches all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
27:38:00,of the violence Interrupters but also with the expansion that we're having at UMC of our uh trauma-based recovery,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
27:45:00,program uh you know we have thought that these should align uh and can align to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
27:52:00,make sure that we are reaching as many people in our community as possible whether or not they are people who have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
27:59:00,been victims within the emergency room but providing those Services after the fact uh the violence and erupter program,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
28:06:00,when put in place our goal is that we would have in erupters available 24 7 7,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
28:11:00,days a week and in the emergency room to be able to intervene uh and then connect,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
28:18:00,them to the trauma-based recovery services that are being expanded at University Medical Center that includes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
28:26:00,wrap-around Services outside of the counseling that needs to happen but really doing the work of uh helping them,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
28:33:00,case manage social workers to get them connected to services and continue that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
28:39:00,work and hopefully to to recover uh and become healthier in terms of the impacts,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
28:45:00,of violence so we really appreciate the fact that you all are considering uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
28:50:00,fundingness that you all trust University Medical Center along with our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
28:55:00,Tulane and LSU colleagues to put this together and our goal is to build a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
29:01:00,program that we can bring back metrics to you all on its effectiveness at some point in time as we get it going so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
29:07:00,thank you very much thank you Miss parents for your presentation at this time council members yes we'll we'll,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

29:26:00,your presentation you pretty much said everything that I was I was going to say I think the the coordination and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
29:32:00,collaboration with the Trauma Centers is is going to be incredibly helpful and and as you know this entire Council uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
29:39:00,supported and passed the ordinance to that led to the expansion of the trauma center are now helping uh 5 000 people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
29:45:00,is what we're projecting which would be great I thought it was a real disappointment that the violence interrupter program,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
29:51:00,um ended up languishing and disappearing so the fact that UMC is going to bring it back I think is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
29:57:00,is going to be um great and then also work on different ways as to like how can we expand it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:03:00,um as well in looking at what Baltimore was able to do with their violence Interrupters they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:09:00,at the end of the day we're able to hire roughly 60 people which is a lot um how many do you plan to start with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:15:00,and um you know what are kind of the next steps to grow it sure so I think our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:21:00,first goal and I'm sorry I'm getting this thing um we are meeting our providers because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:26:00,we have trauma providers who are very committed to making this program work and I am working with them through the logistics of what that looks like uh and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:34:00,a budget um so I don't have that fully in place yet as to what that is but I will tell,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:39:00,you the goal is to look at that and align it to the trauma Recovery Center so that we can make sure that we have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:46:00,the coverage in the Ed that we need but that we're also fully utilizing the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:51:00,other things that have been funded through that budget uh so where there may not be an opportunity or need in the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

31:54:00,are we going to best use those resources and deploy them and then look back at the the information and what happens,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

37:52:00,thank you council member Thomas council member Morrell president Morrell thank,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:57:00,you um I want to begin by saying thank you everyone for being here I appreciate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:03:00,y'all giving us kind of a briefing on how the money is going to be spent I think it's very important not just for us but for the public to be aware of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:09:00,kind of the good things that could happen with this sort of money I think I'd be remiss in saying,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:15:00,this was not today wasn't difficult correct I mean we're not scary we're not biting anybody up here or anything right,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:20:00,not today anyway not today anyway um I think it would be important to note,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:25:00,that this is how Wisner money is supposed to be given out in a transparent public process with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:34:00,council's involvement um this is why the councils in litigation across the street right now,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:40:00,because if we're going to have money that is given to us for a public purpose,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:46:00,it has to be discussed publicly and we all have to own how it's spent,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:51:00,and my hope is when all this is resolved and the City,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:56:00,gets full access to all the money as we should have will have even more money,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:01:00,for programs like this because this is long overdue,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:06:00,um we have a Supreme Court decision from 2014 saying the trust should have ended,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:12:00,and all of these assets should be the cities and if we're successful over there we'll be able to fund so many,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:18:00,other initiatives that are important in the city like the ones before us today because every dollar that we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:24:00,allocating today is going to a worthy cause to promote the culture and the future and the young people of the City,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:31:00,of New Orleans and that is what Mr Wisner intended when he originally,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:37:00,created the trust and that is what this council is committed to doing so thank,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:42:00,you all for being here today thank you for answering all of our questions you guys have been very thorough and I appreciate you all stepping up,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:48:00,to preserve our culture to promote our young people or generally to save our lives,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:55:00,so thank you thank you councilmember Morrell council member King I want to thank the young people for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:02:00,coming today I appreciate the hall work you all are doing it's not every day we we hear about positive and see positive,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:09:00,young people I know speaking in public is not a easy task it's not an easy test,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:15:00,which you all did a great job so congratulations keep up the good work thank you councilmember King,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:21:00,councilmember jeruso yeah I just want to say thank you all for being here today and to Echo what president Morrell said,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:27:00,which is this is a great process to be able to discuss everything I think there's a difference too between,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:32:00,allocating money to faceless things that you know may happen and you've personalized both with the young people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:40:00,who've been here today and the people who've been at this table as well and then you know the other piece for me too,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:45:00,is this is where allocation intersects with need,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:51:00,um that's the other part that's so important we have so many needs in our city whether it's Nord whether it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:57:00,violence and eruption whether it's resiliency and sustainability whether it's places like Preservation hall or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:03:00,the African-American Museum we have other places that are very well funded and and they don't need as much,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:09:00,attention and they can rely on their funding to do the things that they're doing so I think this is something that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:15:00,makes it also exciting for us is that um knowing that these needs exist and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:20:00,and the fact not only you've answered all these questions but personalizing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:26:00,these things and emphasizing the importance I think it's important to us as a group so thank you for all your time particularly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:32:00,um on a holiday we appreciate it thank you council member jeruso we have one speaker's card,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

41:55:00,speaker's card from the public is probably the most staggering thing you think there would be more people out here saying good things to good people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:01:00,for doing good work we don't often get to say good things my mind also shifts to bad things which,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

43:10:00,people don't use their paycheck wisely they're people under the bridge that use their paychecks they get paychecks they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:30:22,thank you Maxwell,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:35,thank you council members Maxwell Louisiana fair housing Action Center 1340 Poydras,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:41,um we obviously obviously care a lot about affordability um and so on principle uh councilmember,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:47,Gio Russo I agree with you um and we see these double sidorms developers as similar to short-term,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:52,mental speculators um but I think you have to really thread a needle on this because if you don't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:59,you end up making it more expensive to build two-bedroom apartments single-family homes and affordable,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:04,housing and that doesn't cover those I mean Maxwell I'm sorry to interrupt you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:09,but you're a smart guy I am our Specter I respect your opinion but this doesn't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:14,cover two bedroom homes uh then I'm I'm I must misunderstood I went over this with Claire like 30,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:20,minutes and single family homes keep on going it does I mean if you build a new two,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:26,bedroom apartment does that not require a bedroom or a new uh so I'll double check keep on going okay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:33,um I think that's just that's I mean that's our concern is that this is an over correction that will,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:38,make things worse and I think it's especially true because it requires new parking spaces for two and three bedroom,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:44,homes which are a part of the regular Marketplace for people for our residents not for students,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:49,um and because the language here around affordability doesn't match what's already in the czo that means that this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:57,ICD could make it harder for affordable developers to use the inclusionary zoning the affordable housing plan,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:03,development and the small multi-family affordable housing Provisions that are already exist in the czo they are the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:08,ways that we are trying to encourage people to build more affordable housing in neighborhoods and the language here does not match up with them,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:16,no and Council merger so we said I mean over and over again that when you actually come to put the the tax amendment in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:22,most importantly we hope that you will include a Sunset date because I am fearful about what this will do the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:27,market and at the very least we need to make sure that it doesn't exist uh indefinitely Maxwell let me say this I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:33,owe you an apology because I was conflating the ICD with the parking overlay so the overlay will not include,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:38,this but I think given the dire situation we're in right now this is needed at this moment so that's number,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:44,one and number two I've talked to you before of thinking about we need to have some sort of sunset because of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:53:06,so there's a lot here that's good um there's some things that are uncertain,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:53:12,so when it's declared a blatant a nuisance I mean is somebody going to get a 500 fine or does the city get to go,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:53:23,real one the next thing I want to point out is that sometimes and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:53:29,I only know this through rumor but I know it from multiple sources owners will swap properties if I have a problem,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:53:35,with this property and I don't want to deal with it and you have a problem with that property and you don't want to deal with it we'll swap and the since all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:53:43,this is tied to the property and not the owner the swap wipes Everything clean on both sides so just like uh Thomas Morgan,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:53:51,was here talking about the criminal uh blight Provisions that he put two in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:54:08,thing I want to bring up is the idea of a vacancy tax at some point we have to decide that even if it really is not a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:54:14,blight and even if it is really not a public nuisance and certainly even if it does not need to be demoed it's still,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:54:20,not beneficial to the life of the city to have a bunch of vacancies just sitting there being vacant forever and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:54:27,not being allowed to be used because in order to increase the price of diamonds the beers has an entire Warehouse in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:54:40,correctly anymore either so the idea that a large number of properties are held vacant by people who,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:54:46,can afford that possibly even benefit from it with regards to loans from Banks or tax,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:54:52,reasons or whatever else is not beneficial to all of us we live in a city that's vibrant that involves,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:54:59,human beings that involves human beings being cultural bearers involves human beings being workers in the hospitality,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:05:47,comment for Mr Michael Burnside,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:55,um Michael Burnside 2215 Felicity so there's sort of two different subjects completely one of which is the Public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:01,Presentation of data so in order to do my real question I had to go over here and read calendar number 34 101 because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:09,the blurp does not have sufficient information in it so we don't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:15,have for instance the amount of money that this contract is for you know basic data it's not here so I went and read it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:21,and it says for type 3 Child Care well I don't know what type 3 Child Care is I don't know what type 2 Child Care is and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:27,I don't know what type 1 Child Care is I don't know why we're only doing type three and it certainly doesn't tell us how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:34,much money the child care providers are going to make in the future when we supplement it and it doesn't tell us on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:41,average what they make now so there's a lot of data that's just really not here,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:47,so it becomes sort of a question why does the child care center type 3 not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:53,pay their employees sufficiently themselves,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:59,what's in it for the city to supplement a business owner who's running a Type 3,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:04,Child Care Center I mean the obvious answer is we get our children taken care of but the unobvious answer is how much,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:11,money is the child care provider owner making by not paying their employees well to begin with and are we really,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:18,getting them up to 15 an hour which we all know is the city's minimum wage which we don't know from this either,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:25,so there's a lot of things we don't know and it sort of bugs me but just to uh to answer to that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:32,question because to my relationship with child care Proprietors many of them if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:37,they receive grants there's a certain amount of money that's allotted to administrative costs versus what goes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:43,into the program especially if it's a non-profit the rest of it from uh is business assistance in terms of how much,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:49,goes into per capita child that's part of the uh the uh the daycare or the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:54,child care as well as the money to operate the facilities now is there some,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:00,possible subsidy that could help with them to increase the cost for the people who work there I'm sure if they had,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:05,access to that level of funds many of them would but a lot of the funds actually go into the operation and they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:11,have to choose between the operation the facility and the kids but you're correct that it would be a wonderful opportunity,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:17,to have more who worked in that area could be paid more especially per hour may I have a moment of your personal,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:24,privilege yeah so um I don't know how deeply I want to dive,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:29,into this but the real short version is I'm currently not a Christian but I'm part of a Methodist men's group and I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:35,know that's weird and so we talk a little bit and we share space with the child care center in a building that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:40,once upon a time years ago used to be a very small school and uh it's my understanding that uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:46,perhaps I'm wrong in this that uh it's 200 a kid to send your kid there and for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:52,poor people 200 per kid per week is a non-trivial amount of money I mean I live on 700 bucks a month so the idea is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:59,sending them you know two or three kids the child's care becomes overwhelming right and it's like any other situation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:08,um Child Care gets subsidized by the church to not pay Market rent the church gets a building used instead of vacant,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:16,you know a lot of complex decisions are being made but uh let me shift to the situation I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:23,knew in Philadelphia um the child care there the older members got health care for instance the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:28,older employees but the younger ones did not you know so there's a lot of little questions in child care because it's not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:34,a respected profession quite frankly people are exploited and used poorly when they're in child care positions and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:42,it would be good if the city had an idea of um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:47,what this two and a half million dollars is really going to go for and what it's really going to do and who it's really going to help and I'm not trying to say,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:54,Child Care is unimportant it is important the care of children is important but us knowing what is going,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdORXbpqGVI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
