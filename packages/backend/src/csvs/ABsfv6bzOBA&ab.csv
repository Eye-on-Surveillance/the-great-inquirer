41:01:00,means that we're taking young men that wants to know more about sports and we're able to put them into Athletics uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:06:00,division to work and assist Athletics so those that's interested in doing working in other components we're looking to do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

42:40:00,giving them and that's something that we've never done that nor have we done in uh an area code a zip code I mean a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:47:00,zip code uh study to determine first of all where,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:52:00,the kids are coming from as well as the areas where kids probably need more,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:57:00,organized activity so that when we're putting together programs we can Target some of those hot spots in some of those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:03:00,communities do we know exactly where the kids are coming from and do we know where we would like the kids to come,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:10:00,from especially with intervention and prevention sure so so so we know where they're coming from when they're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:15:00,registering with us by the ZIP codes one thing that we do is we always make sure that we have something in New Orleans,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:22:00,East you know we always make sure that we're utilizing Joe Brown and we're bringing in more programs and we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:28:00,bringing in more opportunities as it relates for uh for our teams out of New Orleans East so Joe Brown is that hub,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:35:00,for that that covers New Orleans East we always make sure that we're pushing and looking at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:41:00,um and Algiers whether it's cut off or a Berman which is I mean Mars Jeff but cut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:47:00,off have been more of a focus in that area based upon the what the kids are and what we know the need is more in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:54:00,that area there and when it comes to Inner City we always look at Rosenwald on in that area we always look at trying,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:01:00,to make sure that we're catching line Center and we're always looking to catch in Mid-City out of Gentilly area so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:07:00,we're looking at the ZIP codes of the kids that's coming in with us we're paying attention to different spots as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:14:00,it relates to where you're seeing activity and that's what we're looking to continue to expand programmings where,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:21:00,we do have the capabilities of putting a footprint however we also look for partners that are in different ZIP codes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:27:00,in different areas that want to be engaged and be a Partners but nor we're open for more Partnerships,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:34:00,uh one of the things we hear parents talk about uh I guess it's almost like a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:40:00,a couple of uh things in America that really don't exist anymore uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:47:00,customer service thing what it used to be in fast food any phase it's just your order and wait and then,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:54:00,the other thing is some of us summer program uh is it me is it the parents we talk to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:01:00,or is summer program now just part of the Summers because what we hear from a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:06:00,lot of parents especially those who put their kids in private programs it's like they'll put them in for part of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:11:00,summer then there's that costs that comes for those last few weeks which is almost more than the cost for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:19:00,those few weeks in the beginning of the summer right talk about the length of the summer how Nord complements or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:25:00,organizers around those other camps because increasingly people are saying hey look,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:31:00,uh the summer ain't nowhere near over and summer camp,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:37:00,is over uh how do we organize that or how do we create in such a way where,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:42:00,summer camp actually means summer maybe with a week for kids to get to get ready for school sure not like a bait and then,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:51:00,you come back and those last couple weeks cost a whole lot of money for families who really would hope that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:57:00,summer camp would have been the entire summer sure sure so so so what we and we definitely can can look at that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:04:00,um because when we're looking at it we operate the entire months of June and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:09:00,July one thing that we take into accounting consideration is that we don't have one school system anymore so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:16:00,you have some schools that start the first week of August you have some school that might start the third or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:23:00,fourth week of August it's so sporadic how the charter schools start their school year some start as early as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:30:00,August 1st and some start as late as August 21st um and so that's the challenge that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:37:00,allow a parent's face um but our camps run primarily uh up to eight weeks,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:42:00,during the months of of June and July that it covered those months however we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:48:00,can look at because we do have a healthy enough budget where that if we can and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:53:00,if our partners that are at the table we can expand the the length of time that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:58:00,it can't run that's something that we can look at I would hope that we would because increasingly time and time again,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:04:00,uh the cost of summer activity is seems to be going up right and then the length,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:10:00,of time for the camps seem to be shortening right so I would appreciate you guys taking a look at that maybe,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:17:00,doing the study and coming back and Reporting uh not just to this committee but to uh the entire Council uh another,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:24:00,issue uh in meeting with and talking to coaches how do we uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:30:00,sweeten the pot or offer more money especially for the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:36:00,those dedicated coaches and those quality coaches and maybe during the summer to attract some of those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:43:00,High School coaches who are not doing travel ball or Au ball who like back in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:48:00,the day when I was involved in Norwood actually coach and US many would volunteer at the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:54:00,recreation department sure so one thing that we look at and part of the challenge that we know it specifically,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
48:01:00,are faced in the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
48:07:00,you worked in the school system and you worked at North during summer months the Educators all worked at Norwood but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
48:14:00,doing covet uh the schools because they received the federal funds they opened,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
48:19:00,during summer months which left us a shortage of having left us a shortage of being able to hire those Educators who,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
48:26:00,normally worked for Noah well we're hearing this summer we'll be successful at hiring more so I encourage those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
48:33:00,coaches that that especially if they want to work during summer months um and to apply we're looking to hire uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
48:42:00,staff during summer months to be a part of the camps and Etc but also what we're looking to do is we're looking and we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
48:48:00,having the conversations with certain High School coaching staff that want to come out and host clinics and camps for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
48:55:00,our kids uh this summer so that's part of the conversations that we're having as well because a lot of our schools are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:11:27,and everybody that was in the community had walked past the ditch that the young boy had fell in and so it was the social,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:35,worker that came on first of the ditch and the social worker said I know I can get him out of this ditch so the social,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:42,worker couldn't do it and then it was the coach in the community that coached the young boy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:51,and after the coach and the social worker stood at the dish they say well where's his father his father wasn't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:57,present so he was not dead I had to get him out the ditch and it was the school,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:03,teacher that came that know him from this code knowing any community that came to that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:12:27,of this ditch and so the more of that story when I talk about the dish the ditches criminal genetic behavior that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:34,the young boy was caught up into the ditches sitting on himself you know broken hearing it's just,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:41,proportionately school systems you know impoverished neighborhoods,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:46,and someone received that this young boy that's in this ditch we recognize in the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:52,City of New Orleans that we have a serious problem so I don't have to you know talk about the problem I want to talk about the strategies or Solutions,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:59,this morning but we know that we have a serious problem in our city and the approaches that everyone says,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:06,the best practice approach so what is the best practice approach so when we talk about best practice we're talking,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:13,about a standard or set of guidelines that is known to produce good outcomes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:18,and results so in the city in New Orleans 12 years ago that was something,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:24,that was created it was called ceasefire in New Orleans and ceasefire in New,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:29,Orleans was a global initiative it was a best practice of course they use the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:34,public health standards and their model was to identify detect,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:40,interrupt intervene interchange social norms and behaviors,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:45,and it was relegated to deal with the one percent of the highest risk in our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:51,city and so since that has been dismantled we recognize that that is a serious problem,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:57,because the confident resolution piece is really missing with all due respect and so when we have that is mentioned,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:04,because we have to look at it like this councilman is that when we look at the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:10,behaviors that are discipline and the cities not all youth that are engaged in criminal genetic Behavior they're all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:16,the one percent and then the model of the public health approaches said to identify detect well how can we identify,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:23,brother I came to one percent we knew who they are on the school system they are the ones that'll get put in in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:29,school detention at a highest rate they are the ones that are being suspended out of the highest rate they're the ones,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:35,that have been exposed of the highest rate their adjudicated involved we have to put conflict resolution in the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:42,schools to curtail that behavior and if we miss it there that behavior will lead them to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:49,more and bigger areas of criminogenic behavior and so what's the next step how can we identify detect them they have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:55,been in a juvenile justice center they have been at the revolving dope leaving it coming back in like it's a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:02,hotel because the crimes that they are committed is the result of lack of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:08,conflict resolution scales and along with the proper resources and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:13,guidelines to get them so if we had a community violence Intervention Program this was the with the White House,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:19,language was using now this is most 24th century terminology Community violence,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:25,intervention and so when we talk about Community violent intervention we talking about types of violence in the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:31,neighborhood residents may experience by going about their daily lives it does not include domestic intimate partner,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:38,intra-family violence it also does not include all forms of gun violence man,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:44,she was in suicides usually are not included in the definition,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:50,so when we look at that like that we talking about violence against young people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:57,in the neighborhood as a result of the lack of conflict resolution skills and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:03,so when we looked at the ceasefire model that was something what we call Interrupters our neighborhood ages of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:11,change and these were the young those people that were high who came from that particular neighborhood Who engaged,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:19,those young people that are what up to one percent of the highest risk because we know who all those young people are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:24,we gave them from a risk reduction strategy when you have people in the neighborhood from a Grassroots,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:30,community-based organizational level we're intentional about knowing who all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:35,subjected to carry guns none who been shot before knowing what's in the background of the family for his,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:42,criminal genetic or Criminal Justice League involved then we could be intentional about going after those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:47,young people from a conflict resolve level and then when I talk about changing social,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:53,behaviors and Norms we got the employer programs that deal with mindset change criminogenic Behavior could be changed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:59,to cognitive behavioral therapy it's worth the resource is it but if we're not identifying the one percent Council,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:06,persons then we're going to continue to have discussions and conversations when we already know where they're at we can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:31:17,when we did this presentation and we talked about this initiative uh on Zoom,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:31:48,uh the areas we've targeted now have never stopped and for my colleagues the reason why,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:54,I wanted to do this again was because I think uh the time is is definitely right,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:59,because we see what what hasn't worked and then secondly we've targeted uh hot,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:05,spots or areas in the district but this work needs to be done city-wide because what we see is that if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:14,we target and do Outreach in areas if it moves to another area then if the resources aren't there and then the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:21,thing that we what I learned especially from your Supreme intervention model as well as you know support uh model is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:28,that the hot spots have been consistent but not just for the last few years but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:33,for the last several decades so the question whenever we've intervened and resource those areas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:38,we've made a difference to suppress crime but one of the things you and I and uh Mr prep we have talked about is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:46,that and it's not to knock the other groups but when you've done you guys have done a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:52,good job of defining that one to one and a half percent and there's nothing against all of the other good mentoring,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:00,but they don't touch the skill set isn't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:05,and their mission isn't to touch that population that people like you and Miss Rhodesia touched which are those hard,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:12,models that aren't part of this nice mentoring program of this outreach,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:18,program talk about the difference please is it not those programs they have a purpose yeah but their purpose is not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:25,the purpose of spectacular folk who say give me the ones you can't deal with it's we call it um in public health it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:32,a risk reduction or assessment for example when we look at risk they got low risk moderates at risk and high risk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:39,and those of the one percent of those of the highest risk and that really means,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:45,those young men will engage in call jacking and young women now young women,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:52,possessing the firearms breaking into calls subjected to be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:57,shocked or killed or subjected to be a perpetrator of such behavior that is the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:34:03,one percent of the highest risk to other organizations are great councilman Thomas I take my hat off to them they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:34:09,are doing great work but they are not touching I have a cliche name they're not touching Benny,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:34:15,black and that's the young man that is of high risk that is a diamond in the rough got,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:34:21,all the great potential in the world but if someone is intentionally touching him and begin to work with men in a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:34:28,protracted period of time and begin to work on helping him and teaching them how to think not what to think but how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:34:35,to think and really build his trust up that young man will have so much of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:34:41,influence as we teach him conflict resolution strategies he can go out in Florida to his friends that's how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:34:47,critical this is uh and then the other thing that in our conversations that we've had uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:34:53,preliminary conversation with the school board now is that you you and the group that we meet would have consistently,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:34:59,said you cannot have any successful Youth Intervention Program without the school board,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:35:04,being at the table that's in the science in that if kids are taking leap tests,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:35:10,and we're we're grading them on their test scores then you can determine by their behavioral tests exactly what the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:35:18,level of intervention or what group they fit in talk about that study and that work that that you've done I could use,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:35:24,myself for an example I went to San Augustine High School came from a two-parent home,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:35:30,went to college dropped out of college got engaged in chronogenic Behavior subsequently served almost 20 years of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:35:43,in criminology what a focusology so it had my situation is totally different,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:35:50,from that young man situation but I had to just bring that in that councilman because when we look at intervention in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:35:57,the school system we can identify that at San Augustine we don't have high risk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:36:03,behavior but in public schools we do we cannot identify that and the way we identified that is simple the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:36:10,disciplinarian at every school knows who get put in detention every week,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:36:15,give those young people to us if they wear ankle monitors we can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:36:21,identify that it's high risk that is not someone we're going to send to a mentoring program until we begin to fix,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:36:27,him from being adjudicated in the system why would we want to send him to a mentoring program where we have not have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:36:33,an intense intervention with him the school system had three Tales of intervention I would like and I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:36:40,specialize in with the highest Terror that tier where you need one-on-one intervention and then we could put you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:36:47,in group engagement modeling the second phase of that intervention we know in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:36:52,every school those young men and well it's young women who are subjected to be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:36:58,suspended because the track record says they have a behavior problem,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:04,and the third of the highest risk of those individuals are subjected to be a sponsor expelled now I mentioned all of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:12,that to say that what the situation that I'm trying to bring Enlightenment and if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:17,that if we what what to meet with the school board we can scale up and reduce,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:24,that behavior because just like I use my example my story I could act I was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:30,academically inclined but I still ended up in prison Behavior have nothing to do with whether,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:35,you could read or write or councilman Tony got to have your cognitive your cognition you know the challenges how do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:41,you have how are you a critical thinker in a situation and that's what where I'm at and so when I look at those young,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:48,people all those tears of intervention in those schools there's no one intention of working with them we will,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:54,ceasefire Corvallis we was in the schools weekly we identified the one,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:59,percent so it will give an opportunity to go into school we're not taking away from,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:05,the Academic Year process but we know research say there's a lot of people in the you know environment who can read,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:11,and write some without learning and they still ended up in prison because it was their behavior that was never put in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:17,check and so if we're given that opportunity to go into old schools and to put those behaviors in check and help,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:24,those young men as young young women they will benefit greatly from Nord they will benefit greatly from the son of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:31,Saint and all these great mentoring programs where we can't send them if they have the highest risk of the one,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:37,percent these programs are not used to dealing with those young men and young women,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:42,we will be working them too much and putting them at a position that they won't be able to scale up so we got to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:51:22,streets and actually being able to connect those Services even beyond the coalition,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:51:30,another one of the things that I'd like you to uh focus on is that programs like,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:51:35,yourself and others you already know the kids you don't have to guess who they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:51:40,are the parents even with the parents as challenges they know you too in many,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:51:45,cases with these other programs and nothing not saying that they don't work but they don't have a relationship,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:51:51,there's a process talk about knowing the community knowing that parent no matter what that parent's function is the level,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:51:58,of trust that's there that even it's right if despite of what they're going through they'll trust that kid to you or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:05,the person who works in that area so something that's that's also different about the New Orleans you Coalition is when I do assessment on a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:12,kid I do assessment on the Guardians and the whole family as well so they helped me keep a close relationship with a kid,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:18,with them also understanding that I'm not going to keep anything from your parent and having the parent allow me to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:23,build a relationship with their kid and that way I have those two different Vines those do two different reports but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:29,they're no we're working to completing the action plan that is spit out by the assessments I complete and it's so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:35,important to have the relationship with a child and a parent because it doesn't make sense if I'm teaching a childist,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:40,and you're not implemented in a home vice versa so and and building these relationships with these parents and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:46,kids it's not easy and I'm not going to sit up and act like it's easy because a lot of folks in our community we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:53,facing trauma and drama and grief and chaos and confusion on a day-to-day basis so to sit through in each one of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:53:00,these assessments which is usually like two hours to comb through all of this it's a lot and to be the only person and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:53:07,doing that because we're unable to hire staff it's it's becoming a burden because now we're getting more and more,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:55:45,uh I think he was part of that group that operated in and around the Saint Thomas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:55:51,it was obvious in the first 10 minutes when we met with him and listening to her talk about saving,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:55:58,him his problem was with her,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:56:04,he basically ran her out of the meeting he had an issue with her inability to be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:56:10,able to deal with him and the stuff that they were going through and her dysfunction uh compounded by what he was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:01:05,done I think that it does make a difference sometimes we look at the negatives in our community and I do recognize that there are a lot of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:12,positives going on I served as a mentor with the Silverback Society,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:18,um and I was a mentor at the gym Singleton charter school and I do recognize that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:23,we made a difference but not the difference that it makes to be to have somebody on the ground every day to work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:29,with people I mean it was easy for us professionals to come in and talk to the young men there and say that there are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:35,opportunities out there for you a doctor lawyer politician real estate owner and the like but um I appreciate the fact,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:42,that you reckon that you are willing to be on the ground getting the work done,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:01:59,and you might have been in the room when I said that but I attended an event recently where they recognized five recipients of funding and um they're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:06,beginning to make a difference with a five million dollar a year fund that they want to make available to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:02:25,seen going into organizations right now okay thanks councilman green council member Morrell and councilmember King,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:02:59,thank you uh I appreciate your presentation but more importantly I appreciated your comments at our last,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:05,meeting I think it's important part of why I harp so much on looking at what,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:12,we've done in the past that worked and how we've our departure from what worked in the past is kind of how we got here,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:19,part of the work this Council has been doing throughout the last year is to really,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:25,create stable sources of revenue for entities that are going to do the work every day,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:31,365 days a year into perpetuity because the reality is that when you're dealing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:37,with youth in crisis in a major Metropolitan City it never really gets fixed it's an issue of you resource you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:45,resource and you over resource because what we saw from your presentation the one before you is that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:52,the problem you have in every major city in New World is kind of the most egregious example is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:57,when you rely upon the business Community too much to fund these programs when they feel like crime is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:03,fixed they just stop funding them I mean when when we have parents in here in the 90s you have businesses tripping over,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:10,themselves to give money to Nord and fund programs but then you get past 2000 and crime's starting to go down they go,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:17,well you know I really need to keep making that donation so we have to create stable stable revenue streams,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:23,inside the City of New Orleans the fund program so you can do the work you do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:28,that works so well and know that you're not at the whim necessarily of a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:34,business or a company that one day might say well you know what that was a great PR move but crimes down I won't do it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:39,anymore but more importantly to your comments last meeting it is unconscionable to me that people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:47,and Personalities in this building will decide they don't like somebody and blackball them or mess with them and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:54,hurt children just to retaliate against them and I think what we've seen in this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:00,last year is that when I talked to a lot of different groups they do feel like that got to a point where because they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:05,were speaking up for kids in a way that wasn't palatable to politicians they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:11,retaliated by reducing or retaking away funding that's not really,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:16,that is the opposite of what should be happening your job and the job all the people that came forth at the last,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:22,meeting today is your advocates for children you don't bifurcate or tone down your rhetoric to make us feel,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:29,better you have for kids and if we have to hear it straight unbiased and uncut so that you can get your point across,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:35,for the kids you're trying to save we should not resent you for that we should applaud you for it because I'd,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:42,rather hear it from you what kids need and what we can do to help than us not help kids and things continue the way,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:49,they're going so I agree with everyone else I agree with with chairman Thomas we're going to work with you I'm going,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:55,to work with councilmember Harris who's a huge fan of yours and figure out how to secure that stable source of funding,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:01,going forward so that you can just focus on what you're doing and not have to focus on what you're doing and also how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:07,you're going to be able to afford to do it thank you we have our one speaker uh Mr Mr Mike Willis,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:13:23,as in it indicates that you have to be domiciled in New Orleans but many people make the register outside of New Orleans,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:31,um as well and so they go through the entire interview process and when they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:36,come in that's when we have to um make them aware that although you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:41,made the register and you're a candidate for employment here there's a domicile,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:47,requirement and so I think that is I can't give you a specific number but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:53,many applicants on the register um aren't domiciled in New Orleans but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:58,they still make the register as an applicant and then we schedule interviews what I like to up is that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:05,I'll just say Juvenile Detention counselor one there were 33 applicants I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:11,offered 23 interviews only five accepted and showed up and we hired two out of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:17,that one was from New Orleans and one had to file for Adama style exemption,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:22,because they weren't domiciled in New Orleans okay that's that's helpful what about AMD do we have any sense EMD as it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:28,stands now 18 of the 22 mechanic currently live outside the surrounding Parish so once they get through the process we have to determine whether or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:36,not they live here and then uh as it stands now we have to tell them that there is uh the requirement to live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:41,within the city but we can't offer them an exemption this Dom is our way but we'll relieve that of the responsibility,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:48,right now so it sounds like you have a pool of about 18 who you can go back after this has passed no 18 of the 22,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:53,currently working outside of the parish I see I see um for EMD,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:18:33,hiring for all positions Juvenile Detention counselors we have some administrative positions available we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:18:39,are hiring for grounds Patrol laborers uh Food Service workers Social Service,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:18:44,workers and why so are you involved on this new task force created by the administration,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:18:51,no for you well um if acts to be involved would you have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:18:58,a problem with joining the task force you connected as I've heard um brother hi Kim speak and um Miss pradesha speak,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:07,um well connected to the parents um I pretty much what we're seeing are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:13,the siblings of past kids that have been system involved at jjicic and so I'm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:20,um connected to those families very closely as well Patrol one of the reasons selection was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:26,kind of selective was because of sensitive information about children,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:31,possibly being exposed and I don't know how more sensitive information would be basically,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:38,you around children all day you know all the information already so how can you be how can you be exposed to more,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:44,sensitive information that's one of the reasons why we were told certain people were not a part of the the task force so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:51,again to those people listening I think that you whether I came spoke earlier are two integral Parts uh of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:58,community that's not a part of this task force and if you are bought on it can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:03,add value to to the task force and help reduce the crime in the city I agree and I am,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:09,pretty much the keeper of that confidential information council member King I am a part of that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:23:27,needs to be made if we're going to actually enforce the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:33,impounding of vehicles for illegal dumping we've been in contact with the Department of Safety and permits and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:38,technically the existing legislation relative to this should identify safety impairments as the department,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:44,responsible for this activity um it was previously the health department it was previously suggested,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:50,that to be code enforcement but the department of safety and permits because it conducts hearings is the appropriate Department to address the issue of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:57,illegal dumping so that's what this amendment is simply to replace code,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:02,enforcement with safety impairments the wording is very simple to the amendment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:07,uh so this fixes the problems we had in the past well this fixes the problem in terms of safety and permits,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:13,um being the agency relative to the enforcement of the illegal dumping yes there's still,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:19,other things to be done okay we do we need a motion councilmember can I just clarify that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:25,needed to um for clarification uh we need to vote to make sure that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:30,added this to the agenda I don't know if that was clear in the last several second by council member Moreno,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:38,five years no names and it's added to the agenda thank you uh moved it uh to adopt,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:46,moves second by councilmember Harris coaching machines,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:52,four years no days and five years no days and it's adopted you also want that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:58,under consent agenda but hang on one second question um I just want to make sure that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:04,everybody's clear um councilmember green on the impounding of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:10,vehicles Etc that that was all already an existing law,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:16,um that the only thing you're changing is that the department that dealt with this particular matter which was the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:21,health department is now going to be safety and purpose that is correct okay because I think there was some confusion,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:27,about that on whether it was new law but it's actually not new law no it's not new law the reason that it was referred,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:33,to and others have referred to as new law is simply that it's an amendment to an existing law but it puts in place,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:38,safety and permits which will devise proper procedures that lead to the seating of the um vehicles and then,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:45,you'll have follow-up conversations with safety and permits based so that they can figure out the capacity to deal with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:51,these particular matters yes they've spoken to us relative to um their concerns relative to personnel,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:57,and those issues and um I have a feeling someone has spoken to you which is why you're bringing it up with me so I just,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:03,want to let you know we had that conversation as late as this morning we recognizable but I will tell you this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:08,that I believe that if we enforce this impounding of illegal dumping Vehicles a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:13,couple of times and make it clear that it costs money to do this that we won't have as many hearings as they think but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:20,yes this is a department of safety impairments um there is a hearing process involved,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:25,there is a procedure for someone whose vehicle has been seized to be returned,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:30,to them after the payment of the fines and there are details that the department of safety impairments will,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:36,put in place but this is the one of the moves here is because the Department of Health for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:41,what whatever reason has not taken these actions and they have concerns that it should have been with the Department of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:47,Safety and permits and so it is now if we approve it gotcha okay and once again not new law just the enforcement aspect,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:55,going from the health department to safety Improvement not new law there will be new um regulations in place,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:27:00,because the Department of Health did not create those regulations but safety and ferment has committed to doing so you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:30:32,about the significant problems we've had in the city with Firearms being stolen from vehicles I think there's been there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:30:40,has not been a robust educational campaign for the citizens of the City of New Orleans to realize how many firearms,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:30:47,that are seized from vehicles are then used in crime what we saw since,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:30:54,from 2021 and 2022 through now there are over 3 000 stolen firearms that have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:31:01,found their way from Vehicles into a secondary Market of those individuals who are perpetuating crime and simply,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:31:08,securing your firearm in your vehicle through a safe or the like or simply,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:31:14,taking the firearm out of the vehicle would make not just yourself but your neighbors much safer to be very candidly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:31:22,play a different way the firearm you leave in your car that's stolen will likely be used to rob you or your,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:31:28,neighbors or shoot someone in the City of New Orleans so please keep your Firearms securing your vehicle or even,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:32:31,frankly I think with our parking ordinance as well I think they could use,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:37:02,enforcement Management District was an idea actually created I believe in 2015 when I was still in the legislature,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:08,which was there are almost a dozen law enforcement agencies already with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:14,post-certified officers already inside the bounds of the City of New Orleans whether it be the Harbor Harbor Police,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:21,the Levee police or the variety of universities these are all post-certified professionals that if you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:29,look at and you add their manpower to the Manpower we already have it could be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:34,of tremendous use in dealing with the crisis facing the nopd and Staffing the idea would be in those pitch in 2015 and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:41,I'm kind of repitching it now when I met with the superintendent she,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:46,mentioned that historically there have been mou signed with a variety of agencies to work with nopd to enhance,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:53,coverage I think we need to return to those Moes with all those organizations there's no reason and I've had multiple,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:00,conversations over the years for example at the levy District which traditionally patrols Lakeshore Drive there's no,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:06,reason why they could not respond to traffic accidents or other non-violent,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:12,instances without injury all the way down to Fillmore they've done it in the past they could do it in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:18,the future and it's something that we should be utilizing right now because when you look at the fact that we have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:24,so few officers to respond to those significant crisis instances having,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:30,those different agencies responding to all of those trivial property calls or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:35,even to accidents where reports have to be drawn up and people have to be weighted with that can all be done and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:41,when you talk to those individual agencies they're all willing to do their part there has to be an overall planner,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:48,overlay for the entire city as to how you would impact that I know that back in the day when I was trying to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:54,negotiate this in 2015 at that time the Olympic police said they could absorb the cost if they would be allowed to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:00,write traffic citations um in that expanded area in the city at that point declined to do so and through,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:08,the city declining in 2015 to do sort of similar MOS with other agencies that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:13,whole situation kind of fell apart but I think at this point we need all the help we can get in utilizing officers some,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:21,other agencies many of whom are retired in OPD or at the very least are live or part of the community they could be a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:27,tremendous asset in helping us address the shortened Manpower that we have in LPD councilman Moreno,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:35,so council member morale I know that um you know you and I have been talking about this for for quite some time and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:41,and if you take a look at uh what happens with Tulane University Police they're responding to incidents that are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:48,happening all around the university people are directly calling the Tulane Police Department to respond to thefts,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:55,and things like that outside of the University why because that mou is in place,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:40:00,um we know that there's apparently work to do uh some type of mou with Loyola but to your point this should be with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:40:07,all of the law enforcement agencies working within the City of New Orleans um we did not see a an urgency to get,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:40:15,this done with the previous police chief but um I do believe that with Chief woodfork that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:40:22,she is you know committed to taking a hard look at this and and getting this accomplished I mean I think that at the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:40:28,end of the day this is just a kind of a common sense type of approach to policing our city and it goes also uh to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:40:37,the point that we continue to make that it has to be an all hands on deck approach to dealing with the crime situation in New Orleans so if we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:40:43,really going to have all hands on deck let's get all law enforcement agencies to work with the nopd to get the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:40:48,situation under control thank you councilman Thomas I don't have a mic I don't have a council member King thank,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:41:13,and willing to help nopd in their Manpower shortage,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:20,that's all I had to think councilmember Greene and I just want to take an opportunity to just think the Southern University at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:27,New Orleans Police Department which has been assisting I don't know if it's been necessarily an official way but they've,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:33,been assisting by responding to calls in the hunter train parking Gentilly Woods Community so the spirit of this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:40,um resolution is something that will have great effects on our city but it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:46,has already been having an impact with those departments that cooperate so that is good news so let's move forward,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABsfv6bzOBA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
