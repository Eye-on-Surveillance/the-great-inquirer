1:43:27,opportunity on multiple occasions with councilman King to visit the Edna car campus and interact with the students,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:33,and I hate to say and use that term resilience because we use it way too,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:39,much like our students are resilient and I feel like when we say things like that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:44,we're normalizing the behavior and the trauma that our kids in the city go through,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:49,and I am always awed by how much our kids,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:55,are able to succeed and push through and Achieve despite the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:01,challenges that are in front of them but you can't think like that without as an adult feeling like why do they have to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:08,put up with this and what can we do to be better so that they don't have to put up with this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:14,and I think that what's so tremendous about this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:19,series the series and the culture at Edna Carr is that y'all are the students are the center of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:26,everything it's about making sure they're okay making sure they have what they need,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:31,and making sure that they are healthy and successful as people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:39,and I think one thing that I've always thought about Inspire schools is that whereas a lot of schools are fixated,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:46,kind of on perpetuating themselves you're fixated upon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:51,creating good people good successful people and in all my experiences,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:59,the Edna Carr McMain all the schools across the city that you all have there's a consistency in that the kids,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:06,feel loved and the kids feel supported and certainly though I certainly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:11,celebrate all of the athletic achievements and academic achievements the achievement,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:17,that I feel most sums y'all up is that those kids feel safe in school and they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:23,feel like you are helping them achieve their goals in life and I think that's really what defines a school and defines,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:06:24,company and we believe that the fire was successive thank you um I would note one,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:06:30,major difference is Carrollton Courthouse was the impetus for this change in state law because you're right,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:06:36,that there's been too many slaps on the wrist for people and I'm not not going,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:06:42,to open what happened with Carrollton Courthouse but your point is well taken that for people who we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:06:48,multi-millionaires into the topic we'll discuss a little bit later today slaps on the wrist or cost of doing business,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:06:54,and that's what we're trying to avoid I do think here natural law has changed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:06:59,based on representative Freeman's change the legislature and our adoption this is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:07:04,the second time this properties come before us for demolition I denied the original request in 2019. if I'm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:07:12,interjection no I know I'm sorry no I'm sorry your time not the same owner I I understand that but but the problem is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:07:19,what essentially has happened now is between the old owner and the new owner we essentially have demolition by,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:07:26,neglect and that's our job now is to try and send messages to people that you can't allow something,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:07:33,to after we've denied demolition allow it to happen again and so this is I mean,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:07:41,I I know I'm looking at council member Harris and maybe King because I think this happens the most in our districts,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:07:47,where it's happened I have another issue um I think it's on on Webster where also,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:07:55,same issue where we deny the demolition left it open and I couldn't find them,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:00,any more money than ten thousand dollars so the problem we have here is this has been a continuing history and Mr Rivera,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:07,may may have been in a top spot but the bottom line is there's a rule that was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:15,broken and we have to be consistent if we're going to try and make sure that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:21,for smaller owners mid-sized owners and larger owners alike that there's there's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:26,more than just a slap on the rest going forward 22 000 for that owner versus ten,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:32,thousand I I couldn't walk the million dollar project you're right it probably isn't fair but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:40,at that time I couldn't find we were legally prohibited from filing more than that so that that that is the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:47,significant difference between situations before the law was filed which ten thousand dollars is the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:53,maximum and now because of the way that the law is filed we have much more significant room so I'll be the first as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:09:00,a lawyer to say the law isn't always fair and that there are times laws change and they become more fair,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:09:06,sometimes less Fair as things go on he's caught in a situation but I also think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:09:12,we also have to be careful not to compare apples and in every situation what's happened because there's laws,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:09:19,that were on the books 50 100 years ago they're also not the laws that we have to uh I mean you've been heard and I've,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:39:54,statute I think we've consistently said that we would like to legislative legislative statue out here to and today,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:02,we've also been notified that Sergeant waterboard will not uh be here uh we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:08,have not waived their right to not appear uh we have not asked the statue,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:14,uh to be eliminated uh something new drafted but this I was advised that the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:21,uh director would not be here and he is not appointed any one of his team to be here so uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:29,councilmember General so I I I think councilmember Morrell was a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:37,state senator when this was revised to provide for this very situation and I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:43,think my frustration stems from exactly what you said first of all the statute very clearly says the executive director,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:49,is supposed to appear if a quarterly report is not timely submitted title 33,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:55,4091-e um I have not received and I'm going to look down the road I assume nobody else,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:41:01,has received any communication about when the executive director could come,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:41:07,if not today and then council member Thomas you made the other point that if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:41:12,there's any personal reason or professional reason why the executive director couldn't be here the chief of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:41:19,staff the general superintendent the CFO or the customer service or the general,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:41:24,counsel could not be here in lieu thereof um and I know we're getting ready to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:41:30,look at a number of measures president Morales has brought and I think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:41:35,along those lines these two principles are related you may not like the laws that the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:41:42,legislature has passed you may not like the things the council has passed but does not permit you to violate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:41:48,and I am tired particularly of City related and state-related entities,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:41:54,thumbing their nose at the rules of this Council so I I applaud the efforts of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:42:00,both council member Thomas and president Morrell in bringing these measures today,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:42:05,because I think it is unfortunately a necessary reminder to a beleaguered,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:42:11,agency that they not only need to communicate better with the public and with us but also that they need to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:42:18,follow the rules that have been passed forward the the the text that I got earlier said that the director was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:42:24,recovering from surgery it did not say that and if his staff would be here to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:42:29,address this the latest text that I got a little earlier said that uh confirming,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:42:35,that I had received the prior text but would be happy to appear at some point,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:42:40,in the future not giving us any specific data time in the future,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:42:46,the main issue with this is a and I don't understand it because especially,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:42:52,when you're dealing with uh directors and elected officials who need the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:42:57,public who need other elected officials because they may want something underneath something in the future,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:04,it would seem to me like the desire to strengthen relationships,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:09,and communication with the public and those officials might get you some support,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:14,for what you may want to ask and if you we saw the one of the best examples of all time of a public official who didn't get,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:22,support for something that they say they needed and they wanted,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:27,so I I would just ask people to be a little far-sighted right uh you don't have to like it uh you don't even have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:34,to like us but maybe be a little makavelli about it and maybe be a little political about it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:40,and how we say in the neighborhood build a little shape about it and develop some,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:45,relationships that may be beneficial to you when you when it's something that you want councilmember Morrell,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:53,thank you uh chairman Thomas this is really kind of a minor precursor comment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:59,so then we have several other measures but when you see situations like this where,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:44:05,the chair of the Public Works committee request your presence and that request is not a request like a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:44:12,polite one it is a with the force of law you can't help but be reminded that this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:44:18,is the same sewage and water board that sent a letter to the council that they leaked themselves to the media the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:44:25,day we passed the final billing ordinance is saying we hear you but we reserve the right to not follow the law,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:44:32,and looking at this current instance that they are required by law to submit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:44:38,a report looking at the fact that they have established that they view the law as optional I would be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:44:45,remissified not point out a very simple fact which really piggybacks on councilmember Thomas's comments the fact,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:44:52,rate payers do not pay rates because they like them rate payers and citizens do not pay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:44:59,millages because they like them they do that because the law requires that of them,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:45:05,and that if people who have dealt with substandard billing and substandard,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:45:10,service are required by law in order to keep their home to give money to the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:45:16,sewage and water board it is beyond my understanding how if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:45:21,citizens of the city have to give them money to be in compliance with the law,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:45:29,in the heck could they believe that the law is optional in their regard,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:45:36,so I think that's something we should all consider I know we have other measures but I am wholeheartedly in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:45:41,support of this request councilman Marina Council vice president,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:45:47,uh thank you so much um chair Thomas for bringing this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:45:52,you know I've had conversations with some sewage water board uh board members and what they have been relaying to me,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:45:59,is that they would like you know better communication uh among uh them,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:46:07,themselves and and the sewage and water board leadership and the city council so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:46:12,I would think that then but it just makes sense wouldn't coming,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:46:19,before the council frequently to express what's going on within the agency be a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:46:26,good way to communicate so that I'm just a little perplexed as to why this is going down the way that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:46:33,it is and I'm assuming councilmember Thomas that you didn't just let them know last night at 11 o'clock in the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:46:40,evening to be here today that there had been ample time I'm assuming to prepare to have someone,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:46:48,here because they'd already missed their initial date okay and now this is kind of their second shot right yeah you know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:46:55,this is as amazing to me as amazing can get especially when you know you're dealing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:47:01,with an agency that not only needs you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:47:06,there's a statue that requires that they appear before you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:47:11,and given their needs and their relationship with the public are going to need the seven people up,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:47:18,here more than ever I don't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:47:23,understand that I I if I was sewage and water board I would be at your beck and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:47:29,call I would be willing to answer every question that you have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:47:35,I would jump through every hoop that you asked me to jump through especially if it was constitutional and Charter,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:47:41,mandated this is baffling to me yeah I mean you know we always hear that word,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:47:47,partnership right and if there's really going to be a partnership that means that um we both have to work at it we both,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:47:53,have to be able to communicate um so I would just think that you know coming to the table and to your point,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:48:00,letting us know exactly what your needs are and expressing what's happening with your organization,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:48:06,um would be just a good way to communicate just in general but but then,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:48:11,it's also required by law if a public agency is afraid of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:48:17,public how will you ever get the public on your side,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:48:26,we will await to see that date that they're available we will not Bypass or excuse the statute,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:48:34,and not recognize that statue because we're trying to help them in spite of themselves,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:48:42,they have no idea how far and how distant their relationship with their ratepayers are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:48:48,they have no idea how much they're going to need this body to strengthen that relationship when it comes time for them,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:48:55,to ask for something that they need from their rate payers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:49:01,and I would hope that this is the beginning of that because it's I'm sure they have somebody,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:49:07,monitoring this right now and I would hope that there would be uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:49:13,uh assertive enough and understanding enough to call and say when they when when,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:49:21,they're going to be ready to uh first of all uh appear before us,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:49:26,their system to continue to acknowledge is the fact that this is statute mandated,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:49:31,and that maybe we develop a better relationship of communication with them in the public in the future,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:49:38,I don't know what else I can say to this but we would like to help you inspire,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:49:44,yourself councilman Thomas I just have my Palm Beach,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:49:51,um my councilmember green and I um I know that somebody is monitoring this and I'm going to ask a representative of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:49:57,the sewage and water board to get in contact with us within the next two hours this is just a date on which they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:50:03,can come before the council so that we can have this issue resolved according to state law that should be a simple,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:50:09,request just to reach out to the council right on Joseph Street not too far away let's establish that line of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:50:15,communication now and it need be only a suggestion but it need to be not that we are being ignored in terms of what we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:50:22,have requested and that the law is being ignored I think that that's a reasonable Outreach Factor if you will and um I'd,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:50:29,like to see that communicated to us so that we can move forward in the right Spirit which is being available to the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:50:35,public throughout the public knows in advance that's all absolutely we would hope that they would uh they would take,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:52:34,because it hadn't been used in 30 years and so they came out and gave me a brand new water meter for free which was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX00_-VUSrM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
