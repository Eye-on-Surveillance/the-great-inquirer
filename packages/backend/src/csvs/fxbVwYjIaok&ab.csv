13:53,what they knew could happen in the street with the pressures sometimes the politics,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:01,in the conversation around whether we appreciate our men and women or not and I think moving forward,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:08,I think we have to be mindful not only of how we talk to each other,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:13,but how we talk to and how we display law enforcement my mother used to always tell me,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

15:13,I have been and this Council has been significantly concerned with the lack of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:20,transparency on deployment strategy let me explain why I'm bringing that up now a point that I made months ago,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:28,when we put officers on 12 hour shifts is that the amount of stress and Trauma,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:36,an officer goes through is staggering during the course of a day there is a reason why almost every law,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:44,enforcement agency does not put officers specifically police officers or law,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:50,enforcement on Perpetual never-ending 12-hour shifts because the amount of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:56,mental trauma that you're putting on them and the lack of time for recovery,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
16:03,it's unconscionable and as you saw repeatedly when this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
16:08,Council continued to ask the department when are the 12 hour,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
16:14,shifts going to end when are we going to stop treating our officers like their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
16:19,pieces on a chessboard and deploy Mr agya simply puts them in places without,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
16:24,any accounting for what it is actually doing to them when we fought,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
16:31,and argued about civilianization part of that argument which was made over and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
16:37,over again is that when an officer comes on duty and has a 50 call backlog before,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
16:44,he walks in the door when that officer comes in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
16:49,50 calls behind with the tremendous pressure to meet a backlog that is never,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
16:55,ending with a department that is not prioritizing bringing the resources to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
17:01,take those pressures over off of those officers these are men and women who are doing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
17:09,tremendous work to keep us safe and we need to honor and respect those officers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
17:16,specifically those patrolmen who are interacting with the public on a daily basis police officers often do not see,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
17:23,people at their best they see them at their worst and when they're in crisis,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
17:29,and as we continue to work through what this Council will,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
17:35,do for this department our return to that comment we cannot continue to think that by overworking,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
17:43,our office officers to not give them the time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
17:48,and resources necessary to recover from their shifts,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
17:54,to put the pressures of solving the problems of the world on a patrolman's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
17:59,back when they really have no control over anything in their lives including how many hours they work in a day or a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
18:05,week it's not tenable and as we move forward this year in the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
18:10,budget as we move forward um with looking at who the next chief will be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
18:16,it is very important to me personally as a brother a police officers to say I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
18:23,want to hear from the next chief how they intend to resolve these issues how they intend to get officers off 12-hour,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
18:30,shifts how they intend to deal with the mental health issues incumbent upon moving them around the city in untenable,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
18:37,situations with non-transparent employment strategies and how we're going to make them safer because I would,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
18:43,argue that the tremendous amount of officers that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
18:48,have left this department a lot of that's because of the pressures,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
18:54,and the trauma and the hopelessness they feel on the job and the fact that many of those officers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
19:00,do not leave Law Enforcement they leave the nopd says that that isn't an OPD,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
19:05,problem not just a general law enforcement problem thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
19:12,okay so we have one item on the agenda let me bring up Jeff Asher,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
19:18,along with our friends from the Fraternal Order of Police detective Augustine and Donovan livacary if you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
19:25,could come to the table let me make some some quick uh opening remarks as you all make your way,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
19:31,so the agenda item that we're going to be discussing today it's the results of a of a survey and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
19:38,this survey I teamed up with the Fraternal Order of Police so that we could ensure that it got out,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
19:45,to as many nopd officers as possible the survey really centered around working,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
19:52,conditions at the nopd along with what were the actual incentives that nopd,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
19:59,officers wanted when it came to keeping officers within the department,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
20:05,now what's interesting is that unfortunately until now a questionnaire like this on incentives had not been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
20:12,administered as I mentioned the the questions didn't just come from uh you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
20:18,know the city council they came from uh Folks at the Fraternal Order of Police particularly detective Augustine who,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
20:25,worked so closely with the officers so that we could really get to you know items that maybe we weren't thinking,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
20:31,about but that officers had been really thinking about so the results of the survey and Jeff is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
20:38,going to go in great detail into them but I just wanted to just briefly say what what they showed that the results of this of the survey,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
20:45,you know at the end of the day demonstrated that the priorities uh for officers are are pretty simple they they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
20:51,want fair and and predictable pay increases and better equipment and we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
20:56,also gauged officer satisfaction now this result was not good 86 of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
21:03,respondents said that they were dissatisfied with the Department mentioning cronyism favoritism and only,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
21:09,getting promoted based on who you know and not based on ability and experience,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
21:14,so if we don't change obviously this level of dissatisfaction with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
21:19,Department it's really not going to matter what type of incentives that we have we at the end of the day have to have to really change the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
21:26,the culture within the nopd and and I think in my opinion what this really,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
21:32,demonstrates is that officers are really begging for for fairness and for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
21:38,transparency which I guess brings us to also the big issue that we're facing now,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
21:43,and JP mentioned it a bit and that's on on the selection of of a new police chief who will be that next person to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
21:50,lead the department well based on what we saw in the survey on on officers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
21:56,perception of the department or what could actually be the reality of the of this department is that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
22:03,this is really the selection process is really begging for a clear,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
22:08,open and fair process uh when it comes to picking the chief that we are truly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
22:14,uh vetting the qualifications of this of this new police chief and uh in an open,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
22:22,and transparent setting uh that everyone is able to understand the priorities of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
22:28,the new uh police chief and I'll be you know candid here I think that the way,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
22:33,that we achieve this was laid out in a letter that the council presented to the mayor just,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
22:40,earlier this week on Monday which said look um you know let's let's let's do a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
22:46,search of of local candidates of candidates from you know potentially other other parts of of the country and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
22:54,then whoever has chosen let's put them through the the council confirmation process and then everyone will be able,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
23:01,to uh to see that the process was there and that the person who will be the next,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
23:07,chief is truly uh qualified and has the right priorities to lead uh the department so I know I kind of went off,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
23:14,on on on a side note there uh but I I just think that that the results of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
23:19,survey really prove that that's the direction that not only the men and women of the nopd,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
23:25,wanted to go in but uh also the the people of this city so with that um I'll turn it over to you Jeff but if you'd,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
23:32,like to make some opening statements detective or Mr Liva Carey yo please do so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
23:38,I I would if you don't absolutely I wanted to thank uh the council for their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
23:44,uh comments this morning um regarding our tragic loss from yesterday morning,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
23:52,[Music] um it's unfortunate that these uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
23:58,you know these things seem all too common uh around the country,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
24:03:00,um you know you look at these uh surveys and uh you know law enforcement is in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
24:11:00,the same boat with uh some other professions like uh attorneys and uh and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
24:19:00,Physicians with where where there's a a high number of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
24:25:00,uh substance abuse uh problems and it's because of the stress and the the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
24:34:00,things that were mentioned in your comments uh and I I I'm happy to see,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
24:43:00,that this is prioritized um you know by by the uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
24:51:00,the commission as as councilman Thomas said this is a it's a dangerous job,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
24:57:00,um you know we don't need to make things worse as councilman morale said I mean,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
25:02:00,we're going to keep these these 12-hour shifts uh as you know as long as as we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
25:10:00,as long as we need them uh unfortunately I don't think right now that we have enough people in general,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
25:17:00,to move away from them yet but when we get to that point we need to be able to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
25:22:00,uh to do that because it's it sounds like uh what I'm hearing is that the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
25:28:00,10-hour shifts are probably um one of the better ways to to go and they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
25:35:00,seem to be well liked around the country but uh but we we haven't gotten to the point in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
25:42:00,Manpower yet that we can consider switching to 10 hour shifts,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
25:49:00,um we've made some progress with mental health and I'm and it's nice to uh uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
25:54:00,for that to just have we have uh Chris Abbott who has expanded the officer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
26:00:00,assistance program which uh has really provided a um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
26:06:00,a terrific service to uh to anybody who has problems that want to uh go,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
26:13:00,seek some kind of help um I remember it wasn't that long ago that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
26:19:00,I people would call me as one of the attorneys to to say you know I I I'm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
26:25:00,having this problem and I need some help with and you know I you know I'm not an employee of the city,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
26:33:00,you know I mean I do my best to to help everybody but it's Chris is in a better,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
26:38:00,position to to be able to address uh these kind of problems so anyway I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
26:43:00,appreciate that and um you know hopefully we'll be able to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
26:48:00,expand uh the mental health awareness uh and uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
26:56:00,services that are available uh moving forward,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
27:01:00,my name is Mary Lou Augustine and I wanted to thank president Moreno for allowing us to do this survey I think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
27:08:00,from watching these meetings you guys are very data driven you want to see the data and when I would watch these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
27:14:00,meetings I'd be like if only you could see what the officers really wanted and you know a lot of people say a lot of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
27:20:00,the officers didn't get to take the survey well now that they know that you're taking this seriously maybe the next time we put a survey out they'll,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
27:27:00,know hey let's respond because action's going to be taken and I think it's very important when we look at the responses,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
27:33:00,that the act that the officers see that there's some kind of action being taken if nothing's being taken no one's going,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
27:39:00,to want to take another survey and I think it's very important that they that they know that they have your guys's support and for those that are watching,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
27:46:00,they want to see what's going to happen they want what they put on here and you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
27:52:00,know and we're just happy to have this platform to be able to explain it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
27:57:00,yeah I really appreciate you all because um the partnership with you all uh you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
28:03:00,all were able to make very clear to officers like look you're going to respond to this but it's going to be kept confidential and as you see from,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
28:09:00,the survey there's no way to be able to identify who any of the respondents were so I hope that once they see this survey,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
28:15:00,they'll say oh wait you know they really did keep their word on confidentiality and all of that and Jeff we'll talk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
28:21:00,about this later but one of the things that we are interested in doing is uh potentially doing frequent surveys and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
28:27:00,not super long ones like this but just so that we have a kind of a tracking of what's happening with working,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
28:32:00,environments at the department what's happening with morale so that we can keep a constant gauge instead of just,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
28:38:00,trying to respond when everything's already on fire so anyway with that Jeff I'll turn it over to you without all of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
28:44:00,the Thunder stolen from uh the the things I was gonna announce uh good,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
28:49:00,morning council members it's a pleasure to be here in front of you again um it's a pleasure to present the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
28:55:00,results of this survey which I think are very different from any type of survey,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
29:00:00,that's been done for nopd officers uh the only really publicly available surveys that we've had are from the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
29:08:00,consent decree monitors who surveyed in 2014 and 2016 but it was a very different set of questions and I know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
29:14:00,council president you asked me to to include some of that and it was just so different from the type of survey that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
29:19:00,we performed here that it really wasn't comparable um this is I think a very useful,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
29:25:00,instrument for gauging officer we talk about officer morale we talk about officer attitudes we never actually,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
29:31:00,measure it and so I think that this is an excellent way to be able to to measure it to talk about it this is not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
29:37:00,a good news story it is not a bad news story it is just a story that presents opportunities for how we respond to them,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
29:45:00,and we got 268 responses they were all Anonymous so we don't know who the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
29:50:00,officers are there's not emails in there that we could publish or anything like that it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
29:56:00,um entirely anonymous uh 28 of commissioned officers right now which I thought was excellent and it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:02:00,it's really encouraging to hear that uh that there are officers that we ran it for a week and there were officers that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:08:00,said oh I didn't see this I wish I'd been able to participate so um very encouraging that we could have even gotten a larger percentage,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:16:00,um the consent decree surveys were surveying a much smaller portion of the agency and they were surveying a much,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:24:00,older portion of the agency so as I'll show in a minute this really reflects who's in in nopd right now very well,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:30:00,um so very pleased with not just the number but it wasn't just leadership or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:36:00,it wasn't just the newest officers that replied it really was across the department um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:42:00,the what we found is that surveyed officers and we've seen this in the exit interview analysis as well surveyed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:48:00,officers generally like their supervisor they like who they're working with they like who's immediately above them,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:54:00,um they are not satisfied with the department and what we found in this survey is that there's deep,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
31:00:00,dissatisfaction with the promotional process and the transfer process and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
31:05:00,it's uh it really goes across the entire department and that that really comes through in the data we talked about the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
31:12:00,benefits we presented I believe 10 different benefits as far as these are potential benefits,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
31:17:00,which of these are the most important um I think most of the benefits that they found most important related to uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
31:24:00,not just pay raises but implementing regular pay raises making it so that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
31:29:00,it's not every five years you get a pay rate but it's it's every year that you get some sort of small increase to keep,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
31:36:00,up with cost of living and other things um we run into this truly blind as to what we would find I know that we there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
31:41:00,were uh there were policy benefits that that we went in thinking no this is what they're going to want and it just wasn't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
31:48:00,at the top of the list so I think it's good to be able to say these are the things that they want and these are the things that while they some people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
31:55:00,really want them the bulk of the respondents did not inherently want those so these two tables show on the left how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
32:03:00,the survey responses were compared to nopd as a whole um by Rank and on the right by number of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
32:10:00,years of service the on the left you can see what we have is generally what you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
32:17:00,get within nopd um slightly more sergeants and lieutenants but generally in line with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
32:23:00,with the percentages that you would expect if you just sorted at a random draw on the right you can see that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
32:30:00,slightly under surveyed the uh the 20 plus year range,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
32:37:00,um we got 28 percent have 20 plus years of the survey respondents 35 percent of nopd officers slightly more 5 to 19,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
32:45:00,years than we would expect from a random sample but generally within within the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
32:51:00,margins of what we would expect I think and just as we go through note that when,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
32:56:00,we're talking about things like retirement we're generally talking to to maybe a couple more younger officers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
33:01:00,than we would expect if we had moral older officers there's going to be more that are closer retirement more that are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
33:08:00,considering retirement with nopd because they've already got 15 to 20 years of experience so here are the tables for the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
33:16:00,satisfaction we asked whether or not they are satisfied with their Department with their supervisor with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
33:22:00,promotional process and with the transfer process the blue our nose the gray are yeses as you can see the uh the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
33:31:00,blue is pretty pretty prominent in the department promotional process and transfer questions the top right is the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
33:38:00,supervisor question that's an 80 20 split in terms of yes satisfied with supervisor no,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
33:45:00,um not satisfied I'll note that we've analyzed 150 or so exit interviews this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
33:50:00,year and this is very much in keeping with what we're hearing from the officers who have left uh compared to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
33:56:00,the officers that are here and so now we're talking about multiple data sources of understanding what nopd,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
34:02:00,officers or recently departed nopd officers are thinking um and this is a very common theme,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
34:08:00,dissatisfaction with the Department right now very much satisfaction with their supervisors and so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
34:15:00,um I think that these are very very important points when we talk about who is going to be the new next chief this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
34:22:00,is something that the next chief is going to happen have to Grapple with and if next chief is going to be successful then this you can't look away you can't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
34:30:00,ignore this you can't say that this is fake data this is something that is just has to be dealt with and if not then the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
34:37:00,next chief will be probably short-lived uh what year will you become eligible,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
34:42:00,for retirement uh we got 39 that said that they're currently eligible,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
34:48:00,um and 55 of those that that knew um when they were retired 55 said they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
34:55:00,were eligible within the next three years noting that we are probably under sampling people that are eligible for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
35:01:00,retirement now or shortly uh we probably would have gotten a couple more in that area but it does certainly suggest that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
35:07:00,there's a large section of individuals within nopd that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
35:13:00,are about retirement ready some of those are are going to be there for a while more that they may be retirement,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
35:19:00,eligible but they want to stay for more years some I know that it's been talked about that there's going to be large,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
35:25:00,payouts coming in the next year in the next 12 months um really in the next three months and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
35:30:00,so there's questions as to uh what will be done once those are received will,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
35:37:00,officers that are eligible retirement leave and that's something that we're going to be measuring going forward very closely,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
35:44:00,um I will note that the 72 and we'll I'll get into the not planning to retire from an OPD question but a large chunk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
35:50:00,of people stated that they were not planning to retirement I just wanted to call that out,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
35:55:00,um because on the next slide we see that it's largely the younger officers the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
36:00:00,newer officers that don't see themselves retiring from nopd um I don't know the degree to which this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
36:05:00,is an NOP nopd specific issue or gen Z and Millennials are Our Generations just,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
36:11:00,I never saw myself standing here for 30 years so I can't but graduate an nopd officer for not wanting to be anywhere,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
36:17:00,for 30 years um but almost half of the police officers said that they were not the the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
36:23:00,PO ranks said that they were not planning to retire um versus less than 20 percent of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
36:29:00,lieutenants and sergeants and I think all four of our captains said they are planning to retire which makes total sense because if you've got 20 years in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
36:35:00,the department you're a lieutenant why would you retire now if you can stay three more years and get retirement with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
36:41:00,full benefits um similarly those without 10 years less than 10 years of experience almost half,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
36:48:00,of them said that they were not planning to retire from nopd compared to those with 20 years and up,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
36:54:00,less than 10 percent of them said that they were not planning to retire from nopd which again makes sense why if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:00:00,you've got 20 more years 20 more years you're probably going to be there for 25 to 30 years I do think that this is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:06:00,something that the department will have to Grapple with that the newer members of the department don't see this as a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:13:00,30-year career and that's something that companies across the country have to deal with and this data pretty much lays,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:20:00,clear that this is something that the police department is also going to have to deal with the 30-year pension is not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:27:00,the selling point inherently that it maybe was 20 or 25 years ago,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:33:00,um so then we asked on a scale of one to five with one being least likely five,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:39:00,being almost certainly How likely each officer was to leave nopd within a year,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:45:00,within one to three years within three to five years and then with five or more years,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:51:00,um as you can see there were 26 that said they were almost certainly going to leave within the next year,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:56:00,um that would largely fit I think we got 268,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:01:00,responses 26 would be 10 we have a 10 10 to 15 attrition rate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:07:00,um that's kind of what we would expect in in a year to have about 10 of them leave so I think this matches very,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:12:00,closely to what we would expect um the one to three years I think is is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:17:00,a little scary because you got a large swath of officers that I think are there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:23:00,um there's going to be large payouts and these retention bonuses that agree to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:29:00,which they're able to actually keep officers there going forward it it's a thinking open question it's one we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:35:00,gonna measure but I think it's it's definitely an open question as opposed to when you look at and we didn't pull them on retention benefits specifically,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:41:00,uh retention bonuses specifically but you look at the concept of annual raises,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:46:00,is what they're asking for um and it's it's unclear absent those the degree to which retention bonuses,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:54:00,will keep an officer there after they've received them um so this is what we get for the the 10,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:00:00,different benefits um the on the left of the table is the benefit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:06:00,the middle is the percent that said that it was the five out of five very important,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:11:00,um almost nine percent said two percent longevity pay every year A two percent raise every year as opposed to was it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:17:00,now every five years um and my understanding is it's just like the fire fire department gets two,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:23:00,percent every year so it's not like this is coming out of left field and is is inherently something unreasonable that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:28:00,other First Responders aren't receiving um annual step increases sick pay paid,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:33:00,out one to one at retirement as opposed to five to one now see I've learned a lot about that nobody's benefit system,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:39:00,um and then equipment upgrades is the only non-pay one,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:44:00,um that uh or is the non-pay one that they got the most,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:50:00,um very important but the top three are the only three that got above 80 of all of the respondents saying they're very,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:55:00,important um things like housing incentives for your subsidized Child Care Aftercare there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:02:00,are some that said that this was really important and and I don't want to suggest that nobody put that gave it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:08:00,that a five or that nobody said that that Healthcare or Child Care is not extremely important to them but for most,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:14:00,officers these did not reach the same level um on the right you can see the scores,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:19:00,average each one one to each person doing one to five um again you kind of see this bunching,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:25:00,of the the top two are really the most important the longevity pay and the step increases and then sort of going down,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:31:00,from there I think to some degree if you if you tell somebody here here are 10 potential things you can get you're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:37:00,going to say each one of them is important um so I think that if we focus on what everyone's saying is the most important,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:42:00,that'll sort of give us the most benefit from these but let me also weigh in here because this is so critical the way that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:50:00,these results came out because prior to this particular survey,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:55:00,I'll I'll look I'll admit I was wrong you know I was doing a lot of talking around the child care piece you know and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:02:00,I talked to Mr liver Carey about it and he was like oh this could be something great you know and it's like outside of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:08:00,the nopd I'd been saying like this could be something that you know creating these incentives would be something that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:13:00,I'm assuming everyone would want and I saw what San Diego uh had recently done as well,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:19:00,um but once we asked the officers they were like that's out that's good we like it but it's not like our top thing so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:25:00,this is just so key to really guiding us as to weight we're not within the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:31:00,department what do the officers within the department actually want and I feel like that's been the problem there's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:37:00,been too many Outsiders whether it's the council the administration whoever else,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:42:00,you know trying to come up with what officers want but never really asking them and never really listening to them,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:48:00,and I'll even say that you know I mean that that comes to maybe even some of the very top leadership within the nopd,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:54:00,as well which obviously now we saw within the survey that that's reflected in the responses as well so anyway but I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:01:00,just when I saw the results of this I was like well I was wrong so can I chime in yeah because I was right because I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:07:00,said the exact opposite I said that every officer they are tired of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:13:00,gimmicks for years of trying to avoid giving them actual increases to pay that go towards,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:19:00,retirement I think there's going to be I mean as we dig into this deeper there's gonna be a direct correlation between why would I retire for a department when,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:28:00,my pay as a once you get past a senior officer your pay is a 15-year patrolman,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:33:00,and a five-year patrolman is the same pay there's no increase and you get to a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:39:00,point where I know we council president Moreno and I've been talking about and we're working with Amy at civil service,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:46:00,if we don't tackle step pay to show a patrolman that there's actually a path to make money there's no reason once you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:53:00,cap out you're capped out and I can't tell you every five years when we give that two percent pay raise it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:01:00,in census senior officers who were like the guy that just got here in five years and the guy that's been here for 30,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:08:00,years who didn't go through rank they are getting paid the same amount of money,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:13:00,and it is the epitome of that let them eat cake argument where you have people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:19:00,who are not involved in the department doing these managerial but they think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:25:00,Solutions like oh you know of course they want this it's I mean it's really simple when you look at other law,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:31:00,enforcement agencies around the region they're all getting annual increases except for nopd,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:37:00,and there's no surprise like I said earlier when we're talking about that unfortunate incident,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:43:00,officers are not leaving law enforcement they're leaving nopd they're going to a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:48:00,different department and so for those people I think there was a gentleman in the eighth District,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:53:00,who showed up and walked out the same day and there was this whole effort to vilify him on walking out and when you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:00:00,look at the fact that you're doing 12-hour shifts you're getting paid the same amount of money whether you've been there five years or 30 years if you're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:07:00,not in rank why like why stay if your family is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:13:00,tired of you coming home stressed if you are dealing with mental health the struggles if you're dealing with dissatisfaction in a department and you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:20:00,can go get a laterally hired to Seattle with step pay and your pay will go up 30,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:25:00,we're not making the case so so if if I can add something to that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:32:00,now I I agree with with what you just said we have 230 people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:39:00,who were hired in 1998 or earlier those 230 people will be eligible to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:46:00,retire in 2023 with between 83 and 100 percent of their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:52:00,salary that's a lot of people uh if they decided to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:58:00,take advantage of their pension that they've already contributed to and uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:04:00,and go somewhere else and start working on it on a new pension um there's a there's another 159,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:12:00,officers who were hired between 1999 and 2003,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:18:00,so they would be eligible I mean they would have 20 years so they could retire,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:24:00,vested in the pension and they may or may not be able to collect and depend on how old they were but they'd be able to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:31:00,collect it at some point soon and uh so those are certainly uh things that we have to keep in mind,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:39:00,well and just to follow up on that uh Mr McCarty I think it's also important to note one of the concerns many council,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:46:00,members put out there was with this one-time bonus in March,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:51:00,we will likely see a lot of people who are on the cusp of retirement that we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:58:00,probably going to be in we're probably playing on being in this massive attrition this year that really they're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:04:00,just holding out for the one-time payment because since that one-time payment does not affect their retirement,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:10:00,and has no retirement benefit once they take that payment and they're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:15:00,retirement eligible I mean I've heard candidly from officers who have over 20 years that's like my that's my moving,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:22:00,bonus or my thank you bonus I was planning on retiring anyway because I'm dissatisfied,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:28:00,but my Hope was that we would be able to use that time between announcing those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:33:00,bonuses and actually getting them to fix to fix the issue right to come up with something that was a little bit more,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:39:00,lasting but but yeah and I said you guys are hard to work at yeah we're trying so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:45:00,can I comment on that yeah go ahead so one of the things that the officers say the ones the ones who have 20 or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:50:00,something years they are going to retire because they they're eligible for their pension they're going to collect,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:55:00,but when you ask them what is it going to keep to keep you here do you know what the number one answer is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:01:00,money like they're all they're already eligible they're they're staying because of the bonus and you ask them what what,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:07:00,can we do to keep you here and they're like well if I know I'm gonna get something you know and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:13:00,those officers are going to leave but the officers that are here that still have 20 are like are we going to get,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:18:00,penalized because those officers are all leaving and now they're like oh the retention doesn't work so it's it's it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:24:00,it's a little well and I mean yeah I mean so I think that if we would have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:29:00,just gone with you know the the top really or well I would just say if we would have gone with the if we would,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:35:00,have just gone with the top four the two percent which is similar to what the state does,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:41:00,um uh the annual step increases which the council member morale is currently working on with civil service,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:47:00,um the sick pay which is currently five to one down to one to one um which you came up with Detective as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:53:00,something that you'd heard from officers to put in the survey which you know we're working on that piece and then the equipment upgrades which we passed um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
48:00:00,you know budget allocations for that we would have just focused really on the basics instead of like these out of like,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
48:07:00,these like you know outside of nopd kind of gimmicky things we probably would be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
48:14:00,in a much better spot and I mean to your point I think we have to quantify when you say the money like,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
48:21:00,if you're giving people annual pay increases your retirement's based on your top three years if you're getting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
48:27:00,an annual increase your next best year your next your best year is your next year but if you're capped out and you're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
48:34:00,not going to get actual Baseline increases once your retirement caps out you're just kind of hanging out at that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
48:41:00,point and if someone comes along with a better offer like to your point if I can if I am a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
48:47:00,if I'm a sergeant I'm a lieutenant hell if I'm a patrolman with 15 plus years there are other departments that will,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
48:54:00,laterally laterally hire me in as a 15-year patrolman if they've got stepped well that's a lot of money and I mean,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
49:03:00,as the council president said not to be that horse it's it's really simple just give people an annual pay raise if you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
49:10:00,have a retirement system based on longevity and everyone's next year is their best year they'll stay that extra,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
49:16:00,and get that top three years if they're always increasing every five years is not a reason to stay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
49:24:00,there are a lot and you're absolutely right because officers are excited for the next three years because they're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
49:29:00,like we're getting five percent five percent imagine if they were to get something like you said step increases and the two percent and two percent,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
49:36:00,every year they'd be like oh well this is going to my pension if I just stay a little longer right right right,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
49:42:00,go ahead Jeff thank you um so this is the question I I think I I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
49:47:00,regret our wording on the most uh just because we asked about the 12-hour shift as it relates to child care,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
49:53:00,responsibility specifically um so what we found is sort of a marginal negligible negligible change in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
50:02:00,uh how it has affected the child care responsibilities as well as marginal,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
50:08:00,change and how it has affected stress um we did provide a sort of open-ended please explain question,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
50:16:00,um and so we got a mixture I would say of hey this is great I have time to spend with my grandkids and you know I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
50:23:00,have more days off and that's wonderful or you know it's really hard to get my kids to school and it makes a lot more,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
50:28:00,difficult on me um so I do think that uh maybe if we do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
50:34:00,go to something like a quarterly tracking survey this is something that we can track a little more specifically,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
50:40:00,as to thoughts on the 12 hour 12 hours because I know that it's been brought up several times during the meeting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
50:46:00,Jeff you and I have talked about actually doing and I've talked to you Donovan about this as well about doing an actual analysis on the effectiveness,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
50:53:00,of 12-hour shifts because studies in other parts of the country have shown that four day 12 hour shifts actually,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
50:59:00,lead to more Collins of sick days on the front end or on the back end so that you're actually you know having more,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
51:05:00,people calling in sick therefore is it really increasing the numbers of officers that you really do have out on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
51:11:00,the street um so I think working on that analysis to see you know how the 12-hour shifts,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
51:18:00,actually have increased or maybe not increased Manpower I think could be interesting and to see kind of what's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
51:24:00,happened with the sick days as well yeah and we've talked about getting with civil service um and I think Andrew was going to email,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
51:31:00,them I'm not sure where that stands but I'll follow up and perfect and a good question for Dr Augustine,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
51:37:00,uh a frequent exchange that I've had with the chief on 12-hour shifts is if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
51:42:00,we're doing 12-hour shifts but we're not authorizing overtime you're really just,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
51:48:00,reshuffling the eight hours you'd have over a normal work week I'm trying to understand what is the Manpower,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
51:55:00,Advantage if we're not if we have an officer let's say for a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:00:00,48-hour work week and we're going 12-hour shifts which means that we're Shifting the four days,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:07:00,versus five you're not generating more police officers out of the air you're just redistributing them based upon a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:13:00,12-hour shift when you're not actually getting I'm trying to figure out and it's never been explained to us as you know the Consultants don't speak to us,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:20:00,because they work for the management not for the council but it's never been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:25:00,explained to me as a deployment strategy if we're not excessively authorizing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:31:00,over time how many more extra hours are you actually getting out of officers oh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:37:00,I I would not be able to answer that question okay I just don't I'm not on the 12 hours I'm on the eight hours I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:45:00,we can include that in the next survey but I mean I've I've had numerous,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:50:00,conversations about the math just if we were told I think last time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:57:00,that overtime would be granted if asked which wasn't really much of an answer but but when I asked specifically,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
53:04:00,mathematically if the set amount of hours per week per officer is what the goal is not to go,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
53:12:00,over overtime and we're simply redistributing their existing hours into a 12-hour shift format versus an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
53:18:00,eight-hour shift format but they're working the same amount of hours mathematically how does that increase,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
53:24:00,coverage we can do the math um we can I mean the way that I would measure it and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
53:29:00,what we have um is we can measure sort of the median response time per hour of day and what,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
53:37:00,we see is that in the first part of the year you kind of have three spikes on it at uh you know first shift change second,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
53:44:00,shift change third shift change and they're kind of medium sized and then in May when they did the shift to the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
53:51:00,12-hour shift uh we see the that middle Spike goes away and the two Edge spikes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
53:57:00,go up and so we we can certainly measure the degree to which it affects having,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
54:06:00,um you know do you are you sacrificing much longer response times for the two,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
54:11:00,hours for sort of medium response times in the third hour and whether or not it's a net positive and I know from the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
54:17:00,incident that happened at the Superdome with the guy with a knife uh I had communication with officers who,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
54:23:00,explained the early car late car uh situation between patrols to me and a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
54:29:00,lot of officers reached out to me and said we were real it Illustrated the concern they had that the Reliance upon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
54:35:00,the earlier late car to respond to incidents while everyone is in roll call,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
54:41:00,during those 12-hour shift changes that those officers who are in the early late late car,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
54:47:00,there are many instances in which they don't have necessary access to backup because everybody from the 12-hour ship,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
54:53:00,is in roll call in that that was another concern and I think these are the kind of logistical like you're kind of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
54:59:00,getting into the weeds but these are when officers are telling me these are kind of logistical loopholes that need,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:06:00,to be closed and that the idea that any officer is going to be riding alone in a car by himself for that hour of shift,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:13:00,change as the earlier late car to cover roll call that is a very dangerous hour for that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:20:00,officer who's in the earlier late car and it's one of those things that when you have the 12-hour shift massive,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:26:00,switching it puts more pressure on that person who's in that earlier late car so that's something else we should probably,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:32:00,look into as well yeah and we can do that we'll need some data from nrpd on the units available but we can basically,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:37:00,do average units available per hour of day and that'll show you you know at 6 a.m per District in the Seventh District,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:44:00,there's one caller that's available on average versus at 8 AM there's six cars,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:50:00,on average or whatever that number might be thank you councilmember Thomas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:56:00,you know I was trying as much as possible to save my voice a lot we have a lot of good questions that have been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:01:00,asked uh but it's someone who's been part of teams and organizations uh there are a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:07:00,few things you're trying to accomplish with surveys uh you wanna you wanna have a survey based on what the overall,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:12:00,mission is uh with the function the charter function of that agency is and then usually also in surveys especially,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:19:00,when I've been part of teams and whether in college or not uh you have to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:24:00,evaluate your own performance so was there any thoughts or what is there a part of here that asks the officer like,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:31:00,my coach would say are you given 100 what do you think your performance is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:37:00,based on our record what we're trying to do to win the division of the national title where are we was there some,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:44:00,consideration on that because we can talk about how people feel,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:49:00,but in many cases how they feel especially when you're part of a team,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:54:00,based on my limited knowledge also can be a reflection of the overall group so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
57:00:00,is there somewhere we can do you have that information have we thought about that information,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
57:05:00,we didn't include that specifically in the survey but I think that would be an excellent question for a sort of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
57:10:00,quarterly tracking survey um so that you could measure that over time well,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
57:18:00,all the questions are good but as someone who's been part of a team if everyone on the team isn't mostly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
57:25:00,committed to the mission of the goal based on their performance their ability their position within the organization,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
57:32:00,it will always hamper the outcome of the goal of the team so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
57:38:00,hopefully in our next survey especially since it's this is secretive and we're respecting uh the privacy of the people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
57:45:00,who participated I I it would be nice to know how they feel about where they are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
57:50:00,uh in terms of their performance and what they're trying to do the other thing is since we have two law enforcement,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
57:56:00,experts uh how how does this affect where we've been uh especially over the last several,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
58:04:00,decades right when you but you've studied the New Orleans Police Department at one point we had a homicide celebrated less around 20,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
58:10:00,percent I think the homicide salt right now is like 45 but the national average is 60 percent uh I remember Mr Parker,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
58:19:00,one time he was a one-man gang when you talk about car thefts and stuff like that but because he didn't have more,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
58:25:00,people in that unit it was difficult to retrieve stolen cars or to solve those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
58:31:00,cases so as it relates to this survey how do you guys think it's going to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
58:37:00,impact especially because even though we've moved up and homicide celebrate we're still 20 percentage points below,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
58:42:00,the national average so for me the survey is fine in terms of how officers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
58:48:00,feel about where they work but I'd like to know about how they feel about the work they do and ultimately about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
58:54:00,attacking those homicide rates robbery rates domestic violence rates rape rates,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:00:00,because consistently if you look at the data as a really sad Department within,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:05:00,40 or 50 years we've lagged behind the national average so ultimately how do we use this to impact those areas excuse my,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:11:00,voice so I think when when we're talking about the the officers and their goals like,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:19:00,you said I've played in teams before the the officers have goals it's just a matter of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:25:00,do they have the equipments and the resources to be able to do that if you look at some departments some detectives,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:30:00,don't have vehicles so you when you ask about like how are they doing this well if you give a detective you don't give,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:37:00,them a car to go and do their job well then of course their solve rate and their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:44:00,investigations are going to be low but if you give them the resources they need they're going to be motivated to go out,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:50:00,there and go do the job and and and do those things and and that's what I was looking for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:55:00,because then Jeff the other piece of the survey is yeah we want to know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:01,how people feel that we want to know how they feel in terms of their performance and what they need,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:06,to do that job especially given statistically if you look at and you know those numbers over the last 40 or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:12,50 years consistently so then I feel this way about the department,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:18,supervision promotions and transfers but if these things were all a Level Playing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:26,Field and I felt better about them what what do I need to respond more quickly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:32,what do I need to retrieve that card what do I need to get that carjacker,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:38,what do I need to get the homicide rate up to the national average and I think ultimately that's what we want I think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:46,I think that the the immediate answer to that question is more policemen and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:52,that's I think that the that was the goal of this survey was to now don't forget now we had like a 20 plus percent,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:58,homicide salary at the height of the department several decades ago when we're in the midst of 400 300 and so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:06,okay I mean you know better than me but I'm just I'm just doing some recall no you're you're right I mean,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:14,the the in the 90s we we did we had a similar Manpower problem and we we ran,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:23,to higher and uh we we we created new problems uh in in the early 90s and you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:30,know we have to make sure not to repeat those uh same problems,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:36,I think that the uh I think that this survey I think that the uh the question about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:44,how people feel about their supervisors is at least,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:50,one indication of how people feel about their team,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:56,um I I do think though that uh Manpower is at the heart of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:05,at the heart of some of these problems I mean the sex crimes units for example have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:10,have caseloads that are outrageous and that there's really I don't think you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:17,could expect anybody to to work with those kind of caseloads but we didn't that's not something that was explored,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:23,in the in the survey but it it uh the only way that we can reduce those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:29,caseloads is to add more detectives but we that that I would have to come they'd,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:35,have to come from somewhere else so it's uh that's that's the question right thank you thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:42,councilman uh two two quick questions oh one is for Jeff uh I think it's also,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:48,important to note that there is some inconsistency in how the nopd reports,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:53,solve rights because there's a national term that's terms what clearance rate correct and then there is the police,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:00,chief's term which is solve rate and it's important,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:05,as we try to compare ourselves to National averages we use the same terminology and on multiple occasions in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:13,our interactions In This Very chamber when I've tried to get clarity on why there is a local solve rate versus the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:20,national clearance rate I bring that up because one of the one of the issues that we currently have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:29,that really gives me great concern is that there is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:36,an increasing attitude and appetite the play with Statistics and numbers to downplay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:42,problems I think that whether it's the Consultants,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:48,giving the opinion to nobd to report less crime over social media to make it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:55,appear like there's less crime I think that's a great the service on two levels the first is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:01,it lulls people into a false sense of security and I do think that as long as we continue to have our crime problems,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:08,in the city I think that is important for people to have a heightened awareness of their surroundings and what's going on around,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:14,them the other issue which is kind of I think was unforeseen by the consultant,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:21,making that argument you have more people saying well if crimes down,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:26,um if crimes down and solve rates for low I guess the police aren't doing their job and the reality is is that our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:32,officers are dealing with a national Trend as far as crime happening in cities Across the Nation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:39,but as detective Augustine just said as Mr lakari just said morale and resources,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:46,play a large part in the solve rates in departments where officers are having a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:51,collaborative experience where they're being led by Innovative leaders who give them a sense of being on a team working,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:58,towards a common purpose you see great results,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:04,when you're on a team where it's a blame game where morale is low where you feel,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:11,like and I I understand there's some some idea we should de-emphasize feelings but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:17,morale in any militaristic unit and the police department the Army the Navy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:23,whatever when morale is low history will tell you whether it's Alexander the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:30,Great or whether it's whether it's uh whether it's the Romans or whether it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:36,Patton during World War One if morale is low a superior force will,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:43,lose to a smaller force and with that I think you should read the next slide because that talks about morale,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:49,I will note um hang on councilmember Thomas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:58,human person the National Council on policing there's a difference between how the those agencies rate crime,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:05,many of the national rating agencies are based on the performance of the police department not crime uh that happens,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:12,with our citizens in terms of with the local departments try to solve so we understand those differences there but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:21,one of the things that that has to happen when you talk about National assault race as it relates to homicide it has to do with the homicides within,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:28,the citizenry not police departments or within the offices in terms of what,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:34,happens with a lot of the offices so uh there are differences there of the outlined in Perth they outlined in the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:39,National Council and I just think that in terms of when you talk about some of the crime that's going on right now,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:46,as we move to not only the survey of the offices we need to move closer to what it means in terms of salvating those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:52,categories where local uh departments are better at it than National agencies,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:01,I'll I'll just throw in for my part um this is something that we're tracking on when a new dashboard that we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:06,hoping to launch soon on police performance um which measures arrest rate in uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:12,firearm murders and in non-fatal shootings and so by using a rest rate which is the numerator is the percentage,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:20,of murders that have a an arrest this year murders that happened this year that have an arrest the denominator is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:25,the number of murders that happened this year um so that combining those two we are at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:31,32.8 percent of mert of the 250 murders this year have had an arrest which is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:37,different from solve rate where you can have you know the nopd officers have done their job and those are murders,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:42,that occurred this year murders that occurred this year yes um and to be clear and this is why I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:49,said numbers get kind of funny when they report solve rates they also include murders that were,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:56,solved from previous years in that number which which is a national standard clearance rates but we also,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:04,have this is in which they'll do clearance by arrest they'll do clearance by if they identify individual who right,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:12,clear Aspire warrant which means we have a idea of who the person is but that person has not been arrested hasn't been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:19,interviewed but we consider that case all because a warrant has been issued for an arrest yeah which is why I think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:25,for internal purposes solve rate makes a ton of sense as far as what is especially for the homicide department,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:30,how many how many of these cases are we solving it's out of our hands but for this that's why I use that term yeah,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:36,right and it's something the police department has used um you remember earlier in the year we had the conflict arises is when you use,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:43,a solve rate to match yourself to a national clearance rate or vice versa,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:48,basically the only time in which we've had conflict I think in this chamber over the terminology is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:54,if you're using an internal rate to track how you're following cases then you take that rate and compare it to a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:00,national average it uses a different metric is disingenuous yeah and that and that's why we're going to stick with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:05,rest rate because we can measure it consistently over time right um so I didn't mean to get us on this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:10,side yeah no so so Thomas Clarence Reagan some,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:15,homicides salary the national average is is just an indicator of what local police departments are doing internally,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:22,to deal with homicides that that's that's it yeah absolutely confusion,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:29,um yeah I I apologize for a dragon a stone that's right Rabbit Hole you're good Jeff and thank you for for your,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:36,your upcoming work in that um I think that the last couple of slides in my opinion I found to be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:42,um really the most interesting because once again we were really just looking at at a checking off some incentives and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:49,I think uh what we found and the free comments section actually really opened,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:55,up kind of a whole new uh kind of can of worms with the department so go ahead on the last two yeah and I should note that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:02,that uh in the PowerPoint I've sort of messed up the chronologic chronology of when the officer saw these questions the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:09,are you satisfied with the department and supervisor and pro promotion process that all occurred right before this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:16,question so that's the reason that most of these answers are focused on the promotion process,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:21,um so we had 135 officers that responded in the what do you think tell us your,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:27,response um explain your answers to your satisfaction,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:32,um a large number of them and again they they were sort of open-ended responses so some of them were not capturing or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:39,don't fit neatly in a category um but a large number of them specifically mentioned one of favoritism,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:45,cronyism or nepotism um specifically in the promotion process uh 16 of them,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:52,it's called the knowledge skills assessment um and the basically the promotion process a joke,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:57,um said it was unfair or specifically said that it was based on who you know um we did get a tiny number of officers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:05,that expressed dissatisfaction with the consent decree um but there were only three that specifically mentioned the consent decree a couple that mentioned,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:13,the monitors not inherently due to dissatisfaction but we're talking about the monitors the existence of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:19,monitors um and sort of adding to their difficulties this is largely in line with what we see in the exit interviews,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:26,as far as very little discussion of the content to create um lots of discussion about the things,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:31,that affect the officers on a day-to-day process um and then I I called out three responses,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:39,that I thought were good um because I think it speaks to the passion and the the dedication of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:45,officers that they want to serve the department but that they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:50,um they they don't have satisfaction with a lot of the the things beyond their immediate control and so I won't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:58,read these but I'll leave them up for the rest of the discussion thank you Jeff um in the previous slide that you had,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:04,regarding uh promotions and transfers and and the and the comments that we received I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:11,remember when we were in my office looking at the the results in the in the draft report that you brought to me I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:17,guess about a week ago and I was sitting with you detective and and you know I was like wow I can't believe um these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:23,answers and and detective I remember you kind of looking at me like well that's actually what you hear all the time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:30,yeah and I think it was very important to put the add your comments so that way you so that way you can see exactly what,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:37,these officers are going through and if this is only 135 responses imagine the other responses from the people who,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:44,didn't respond and they're all around the same thing they everyone just wants,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:49,Fair they just want things to be fair and and you know the survey shows that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:57,things are not fair but you know and I remember in the budget hearing councilman Thomas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:04,had mentioned that in the course of the Decades of the survey that everyone says the same thing well if everyone's saying,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:10,the same thing every year we should be able to do something about it yeah so well and you know speaking about you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:16,know team and goals right so if you have a goal to be promoted yet you feel that to be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:24,promoted is not necessarily based on your qualifications your your ability or your skill but based on who you know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:31,right there your your your personal goals in in your opinion maybe being,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:36,shot down and so that leads to you know additional morale issues I'm sure that's part of the dissatisfaction piece of of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:43,the survey Jeff um so I thought that this piece was really um really telling and troubling because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:51,once again and I said this earlier you can throw whatever incentives and we can we could try to do all that we can with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:57,with pay but until we really changed the culture of the nopd we're never going to win the battle over Manpower issues and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:04,if I may add so I'm in the Air Force I've been in for 18 years and we know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:10,what we need to do to get promoted to the next rank you have to do this this it's on paper if you do this this and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:16,this if I want to be or be in any position or anything there's there's no guidelines on where,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:22,you got to go and I think a lot of officers they may want to go to a certain position but there's no I mean,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:27,what's the guideline to get there except you know oh I put in a KSA or even if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:33,you if someone has goals of being a captain of a district or a lieutenant or a sergeant it's like what are this what,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:39,are the steps that those officers need to take in their career to get there that they can work on from the very,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:44,beginning and and we don't have that laid out and if officers knew what they needed to do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:50,they would work towards it and they would they would stay here and want to make a difference,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:55,but see why the whole selection process on the chi on the next chief has to be so open and transparent so that people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:01,really can see that it's based on qualifications um council member King and then,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:08,with with that comment we have a constant member of Moreno um is it possible to do a survey where you ask,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:14,nopp officers what they want to see as the next chief or not necessarily a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:20,person and that's a little person but what type the process do they want a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:26,local person they want somebody National um they're going to ultimately work for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:31,a work with the nucleus Gene so is that does that make sense to even think about doing that it does make sense and the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:38,officers getting their opinions I think is important to them they want to know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:43,that their voice is being heard and so just putting a survey out there and asking them that there's no harm in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:49,doing that you're just getting the opinion of the officers who've been in you're going to get officers from 30 to one you're going to get their opinion,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:55,and and that's the most important they want their voices to be heard they've never been heard before no one's ever done something like this where they're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:01,where it's to the city council and it's out there so is that is that something something,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:08,that you all can can do a small survey and just get to get their thoughts and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:14,maybe look if you want to partner up again I'd love to work with councilmember King on on on trying to put some type of questionnaire together,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:20,on on that and getting it out as quickly as possible if you guys are yeah,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:29,I think we'd have to work on on that uh to determine some type of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:35,structure and uh how you know how the question would be asked and formatted,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:41,and you can I don't think you could ask an open-ended question but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:47,if it was reduced to a smaller number of people I don't know that's a tough one I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:55,think we could work on it though if it's personally let me know Ashton um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:00,Fraternal Order policing would like to help me be a part of it yes sir okay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:05,councilman Monroe and just a quick point so going back to your I believe it's your third slide,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:11,when you talk about the satisfaction overview and the satisfaction with your,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:16,supervisor I think it's important to give that some context when you're looking at 209 responses across the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:24,field of Officer you selected I think it would be appropriate to say that the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:30,majority of these officers are likely talking about a sergeant but will that be correct is that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:35,democracy yes because I think I don't want people to extrapolate that when they say I'm I am,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:42,I like my supervisor that means I like management when you have the rank structure and the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:48,distribution of officers the immediate supervisor of the vast majority of officers the first ranked,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:54,Sergeant so many of these officers on a regular basis don't interact with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:00,someone above the rank of Sergeant other than a roll call situation correct maybe maybe lieutenants but so for the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:07,most part I just want to highlight that number so that 209 the vast majority of those people are talking about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:13,the lowest rank in management which is Sergeant which is the most plentiful position I think it's also important,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:19,when we talk about promotion opportunities and I appreciate you using the military as an example as far as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:25,like having a clear delineated path I mean obviously people don't like to hear this but I mean if you are in the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:32,military and you have a goal of becoming a captain or a major or the like there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:38,is a process you know if I meet these benchmarks I meet these goals I get there and for a lot of people that's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:43,what keeps them in the military because they have a goal I think that when you don't have a clear promotional process,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:51,and especially when you look at our structure there's a fixed number of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:57,positions at all ranks and so not only do you have to work towards being a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:04,lieutenant or a captain there are only certain instances in which that rank becomes available so the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:10,window of opportunity is even smaller so when you see that massive dissatisfaction with who you know clicks,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:19,and cronyism it's even more devastating because you might be on the force for 10,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:24,years and only two Captain spots come up so if you don't ever if you don't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:30,believe from Jump Street you've got a clear chance to get there and there's only a chance to will come up,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:36,than it really is demoralizing because it's not like the department is is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:41,growing at such a space and with the constrained Civil Service puts on it I mean beyond the rank of Sergeant the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:48,opportunities for promotion are very very competitive and if there's not a clear transparent process,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:55,you likely will not I mean most officers don't see a promotion Beyond senior officer and that's that's it and I mean,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:02,once you've hit that goal on the team and there are other teams that are saying well we have you could come to a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:08,different department and meet those dreams you had of becoming a lieutenant you know a captain a major I know we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:15,only have one here we only have one major in nopd that's a whole separate could be also for being about our one major but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:21,when you take away the possibility of achieving goals on one team that's when,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:27,trades and free agency happens and that's kind of what's been happening with this year with our attrition at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:32,nlpd I appreciate y'all being here um I look forward to other customers comments if I may real quick,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:38,councilmember green um we actually in the accompanying analysis broke down each question by Rank and we do see that uh 90 of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:46,police officer rank approve of their Sergeant or satisfied with their Sergeant compared to 68 of Sergeants,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:52,approves of their supervisor um and with the promotional process uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:57,14 of police officers 26 of senior police officers approve of it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:03,um just eight percent of Sergeants and six percent of lieutenants approve of the promotional process as you mentioned,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:09,their sort of stuff and you know I think when we if I if I just one last thing real quick I'll try to make this short,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:15,the the when we talk about the promotional process I mean you know it's it's about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:22,how the lists are made and how people are selected for promotion as opposed to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:30,the the actual process like transfer processes about how like the ksas are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:36,implemented as as opposed to the actual process that you know that goes along with uh transfers but on the last,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:45,uh captain's exam uh uh you know the the the tests are that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:53,Civil Service have created to try to indicate who would be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:58,the best P the best individuals in those that position that they're testing for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:05,uh but we've uh We've of course gone beyond that the the whole great place to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:12,work initiative which was implemented in uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:18,in the early 2010s uh I think uh we had,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:23,the last campus exam they had uh one two three people that went up 10,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:31,spaces on the on the list they had uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:36,two that went down nine one that went down eight I mean that's a lot of spaces to move,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:43,when you're only I mean the captain's exam is not a very large list like the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:49,college football playoffs it's um and then they they I think they want,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:54,to how many of them how many that went down were Burkhart or Glazer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:02,you know I think that they want to do like these structured interviews but I don't I'm not sure that they're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:10,quite doing structured interviews you know and I think that that they're trying to do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:19,something that I think that they're not quite there it's just that I think that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:24,causes a lot of frustration and a lot of questions about the promotional path and uh you know career,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:32,paths in general but thank you councilmember green,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:38,I'm not going to do my long usual discussion of how the police respond to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:44,say that you do that's so quickly in the last couple of instances because actually there's been some sad out there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:50,but I do want to say this this may be a unique opportunity for the city council,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:56,to take these concerns and get it right,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:02,we're going to be involved with the SEC the selection process involving the police chief we are at the end of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:08,day we are one way or the other we are we also have a report here that actually,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:13,Jeff if I had this report at the beginning of last year maybe when we were looking at budget for this year I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:19,would have been making some suggestions based on what I see here longevity but the things that other council members,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:25,have mentioned are within our power we also have the power to work with civil service to see these changes so this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:32,Council should take ownership of whether or not we make those improvements,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:37,we should take responsibility and then at the end of six months if the changes haven't been made then look back at what,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:44,we haven't done to make these changes I see all these suggestions I think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:50,they're fine I think that they can enhance morale I will give you one little caveat to that that I've been to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:56,around government for a while but it was 25 years ago some of the concerns that I hear officers talk about with regards to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:02,cronyism and things like that but what I heard under what I consider to be a pretty good police chief,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:08,um even in Pennington and I don't think that he did that I think that that's just the nature of a lot of promotion but if we're going to try to be like the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:15,military and make it clear as to what the promotional process is if we're going to have the longevity pay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:21,increases and look that's not off the table for now because honestly some of the we're going to lose some officers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:27,still so we may not spend as much money on loan the bonuses and things like that maybe we need to look at longevity pay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:34,increases right now more so than ABS running in different Publications let's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:39,give the house [Laughter] right let's let's put it into the things,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:46,that officers are saying that the absolutely positively need but I do want to say this as a council,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:53,I'm willing to work with the other members of the council to take ownership of this this year,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:59,to not push the um not push things further down the road if these are what our officers are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:05,saying right now and I think that a survey in of this number of offices is a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:10,pretty good process um in terms of the numbers I think that we have funds available to do this we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:17,haven't even spent all of the funds all right we look we're going to need civil service and councilman Thomas is right,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:23,however we're going to get civil service if we want it we're going to get them on our side there are some things that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:29,can do as a council to make it happen so I just want to tell you that I appreciate this survey I appreciate the depth of it I appreciate your research,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:36,I'm willing to take ownership of this in addition to the selection of a police chief to working with the police,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:43,leadership to see these things happen putting pressure on civil service making the money available for that it's not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:49,the can pushed down the road again after the next few months thank you I appreciate it I do apologize also please,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:55,I do apologize for not having this last year this would have been certainly very helpful foreign,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:06,this council is one year old so the bottom line is that there was a time that we were going to get the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:12,information and it's here now so I mean you may be joking but I want to make it clear that's not what I mean we didn't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:18,ask for it last year but we didn't ask for at the beginning I would have known you know maybe that was something that we would ask for but this is the time to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:25,start it 2023 is when we take ownership of this as a council we make these things happen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:31,I'm ready and to answer your question councilman mcgreen about like why now I think all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:38,of us had constantly been asking you know uh how did how did the incentive package come together you know how did,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:44,that come together and it was like well we talked to officers well you know but it's like where okay well where is that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:49,information where is that that data specifically and it was never really ever at least not provided to me,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:55,um so that's where you know we stepped in with with Jeff and fop it's like well let's get our own data and then this is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:01,this is what we got not to mention that I was also trying to find Outside the Box things that I thought were going to be effective and as I noticed that maybe,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:08,they're not exactly what the officers wanted so there we go so that's why we wanted to to do this particularly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:13,finally an opportunity to attack systemic change and make a holistic,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:28:24,council member Thomas too uh Mr chair I think some of the things that we found in this survey are really kind of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:30,low-hanging fruit that we could take care of very quickly so well once again thank you uh to all of you um I don't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbVwYjIaok&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
