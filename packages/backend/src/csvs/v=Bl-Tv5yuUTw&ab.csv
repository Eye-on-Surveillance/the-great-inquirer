39:12:00,Sugar Bowl is a thing is because of Tulane University and their football team because if we didn't have a division one athletic team in our city,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

40:09:00,there's more about the social atmosphere that it was about how Tulane football was doing at that point and then the new,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:15:00,stadium was built and and I think a commitment that the athletic department,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:10:19,tell us about the history of Mardi Gras in the role that black women would play in the history of Mardi Gras and I know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:26,you guys represent more than just black women but I just want you guys to think about the story that my mom shared and where,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:33,you are now uh back when when she was younger uh when they couldn't parade uh when you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:40,couldn't participate in Mardi Gras and I think you guys represent this and that's why God put it on my heart this morning,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:47,my mom would say that they aren't a friends that would get all dressed up,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:52,and they would put on a Sunday Best and and you know my mother was friends with with your father so you know true,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:59,and in many cases black men couldn't do it publicly because they would get it get arrested especially during public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:05,events so they would get dressed they would put on a Sunday Best they would put on their high heels,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:11,they would have their purses and they would be dimmed in their very best and the groups would parade in front of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:17,parades that wouldn't let them parade and here you here you guys are you put,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:13:40,potentially helps answer a lot of questions that district council members do not only with public nuisances but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:46,much of the illegal activity that happens um but uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:14:04,Ferguson to uh the effort the enforcement effort that was done here in New Orleans uh several years ago about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:11,nuisance bars that once they started enforcement they would enforce the laws,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:16,at a lot of the small and African-American and Community bars with the bars around the universities would,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:22,not be enforced so I I think it's important that we break down the demographic once this is underway to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:29,make sure that and of course we know that when you when you do the national study about fines and fees uh even when,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:37,the intent is good it seems like in many cases that the disparaged community Bears the brunt a lot more than the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:44,violators who are in other communities so I think as we track this especially to help with what we're doing in our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:50,district it would be very good to have that that demographic breakdown and that racial breakdown so that moving forward,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:56,we know that once again historically Studies have shown every time there's a fee every time there's a fine every time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:15:09,neighborhoods where other folk are allowed to kind of get away with the law so uh looking forward to using this too,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:15:15,because there are a couple of places I know along the chef and in other places that that Harbor uh that are also part,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:15:22,of the problem but I don't want to see enforcement like it's like in the past with our businesses uh being targeted uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:15:30,because we don't have the resources to defend ourselves we can't let that happen in this case so if this is that's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:15:37,a great point and and as you were talking I wrote it in as to where it can go um if you look at your second page of of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:17:18,question becomes what does the vacant lot owner going to be hit with fines and fees and punishments because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:26:31,too thank you madam Clark members of this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:38,ordinance is in response to conversations I've had with some of our school leaders in which we have found,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:44,that there have been numerous instances of young people coming to school with a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:50,firearm that was callously laid up was callously Lane about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:27:02,not keep track of that firearm that firearm ended up at schools when administrations would then call to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:27:09,report to the police that a young person had obtained a firearm from a household,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:27:14,and brought it to school um there was no ability for the nopd or the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:27:22,school to have anyone held at fault for that easy access to a firearm that could have led to a tragedy at said schools,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:27:29,what this ordinance simply seeks to do is say if a firearm is not secured in a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:27:35,household if a child gets access to said firearm from that household and bring it to a school or an area that has a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:27:42,firearm free zone that there is someone who's legally coupled for it and that is the owner of the firearm who failed to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:27:49,secure it that's what the ordinance does uh Mr Thomas sorry customer Thomas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:27:56,you called me I'm all right president um we just had this conversation uh on the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:28:03,Good Morning Show with the director of uh Finn's families in need of uh uh of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:28:09,services and I asked him a direct question about the accountability question so uh ultimately where should,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:28:16,it rest or where should it reside uh should it be with the institutions should it be with the politicians uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:28:22,should it be with the the the community and uh the director of that organization,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:28:28,uh that is working to teach parents how to parent uh he said ultimately the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:28:33,responsibility uh is the parent uh I attended two schools yesterday had,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:28:41,conversations with two principals about this question about accountability,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:28:48,and in speaking with them they said what of their greatest challenges is not only,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:28:54,just to get the student or the kid to accept uh responsibility but councilman,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:29:00,Jerusalem also to get the parent to understand what parental responsibility,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:29:05,and accountability means now I know we have some great lawyers up here,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:29:11,and I don't know that we can legally do this but I'm for it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:29:16,because at the end of the day that there needs to be a conversation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:29:22,on where the state Settles where this community Settles,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:29:27,uh and where the legal system Settles and that question has not been answered,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:29:33,it's still a major gray area so council member Morrell I'm sure,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:29:39,there'll be challenges to this but more importantly even than this piece of legislation is that finally,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:29:45,there will be a conversation is ultimately about who's responsible morally,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:29:51,socially and in terms of public policy but the other thing has to happen is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:29:57,each group that I've actually interviewed or spoken with over the last several years,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:30:03,uh Educators that I've spoken to we have all asked the general question,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:30:23,what happened to home economics would teach people how to govern and operate in a house uh in school so uh thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:30:31,if nothing else and you know lawyers will determine what we can and cannot do here I would hope at some point this is the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:30:38,impetus for us to bring families back into the equation and parenting back into the equation in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:30:46,terming determining not who only who is responsible but how do we govern that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:30:52,behavior and if we don't we can't govern that behavior how do we begin to go back to the 60s 70s and 80s and 90s when,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:31:00,there were parenting classes and organizations got got money and were funded to teach people who did not know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:31:07,how to parent how to parent so that's just that's kind of like my commentary but I think this gives us an opportunity,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:06:35,um I am grateful to this Council for including for including Educators in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:06:40,this discussion moving forward because they are critical they are the ones that are dealing with this every day and can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:06:46,shine a better light on the things that are happening in their schools already I was at a parent meeting at Booker T,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:06:51,Washington several weeks ago and the parents said to me unequivocally I've,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:06:57,there were maybe 50 parents in the room and they said unequivocally I feel safe when my child is at school and when they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:07:04,leave school it's when I become terrified and so that is why I keep my child at school until 6 PM so it is this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:07:11,that just highlighted for me the importance of this work and the importance of getting every child in school every single day,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:07:18,uh I'll end by saying you know councilman jeruso in in the last item you highlighted the importance of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:07:31,council cannot do it alone um and so I'm excited for the collaboration moving forward to solve,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:07:36,what is the city-wide problem uh using all of the resources that we have at our disposal thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:07:50,back in in history uh when there was an effort to deal with there were reporting centers that dealt with uh truancy and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:07:58,curfew from 1995 to the early 2000s uh or the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:04,late 90s that was part of a system that reduced uh violent juvenile crime by 60 percent,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:11,and overall violent crime by 60 plus percent in the city which was part of the national average so this was is not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:18,new the difference is it wasn't sustainable I think Mr samadi's comments where we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:24,absolutely on point is that we react and we do things to react to crisis but once they work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:31,either the funding is taken away other programs are taken away,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:36,uh president Paco you mentioned uh Educators uh you can be proud of your,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:41,principals your Educators led the way uh eight months ago when Sharon Clark,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:46,convened a meeting of principals to deal with this issue uh you can be proud,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:52,because yesterday it was one of the foundations of our discussion about how do you reduce violence of course dealing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:59,with curfew Insurance uh was one of the great foundations in the meetings and conversations I had with two principals,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:09:05,uh yesterday they stated the same thing now the issue is if we're going to do this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:09:12,what we found was a material breakdown in our meeting yesterday in the meetings with principals uh councilmember King,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:09:18,was that even when we attempt to do this because our system's in place for it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:09:24,already the issue is reporting how to assist how does the school system,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:09:29,report uh to the parents uh do the parents report to the school system,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:09:34,do the police Den report uh to the to the senators or reporting centers and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:09:41,then some of the information we have right now is that even when there's an effort to deal with curfew influencing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:09:47,not my data the real data in the education Reliance research report that's out right now is that even when,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:09:54,we try to do this you will you will have hundreds of kids that are absent from school,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:09:59,but the Reporting Center only has one or two a month period,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:10:05,so we have a system in place but how does that Network work how do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:10:12,folk report to each other the other thing that was critical in the education research Alliance report is that there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:10:20,are several reasons why kids are not going to school some people like to say it's kova like you know we always kind of label kids in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:10:27,many cases without dealing with the statistics of the realities in a few cases there were kids who were not going,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:10:33,to school because it like Mr Madi said did he get to the root of it there wasn't a washing machine at home to wash,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:10:40,their clothes so once their clothes got so dirty they were like they couldn't go to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:10:46,school because we know what happens at schools now with cyber building and social bullying,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:10:52,the other report showed that there were kids I think a large,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:10:57,percentage of kids because they were not popular on social media or they did not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:11:03,have the right kind of clothes to wear or the g-nikes to wear they did not want,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:11:08,to deal with the teasing or the bullying and then the most glaring report,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:11:13,in that study we're going to do this we've got to read these studies that gives us the real information in that education our research Alliance,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:11:20,study 30 to 40 percent of the kids and in one instance 48 of black kids says,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:11:26,they will not go reporting to school because they saw no value in education,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:11:36,they didn't see how it benefited them socially or economically not my data but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:11:43,the research Alliance report so like Mr Madi said,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:11:48,this should not be a Band-Aid issue I know Miss Clark and principals have been on this from the first meeting I went to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:11:55,eight months ago to beating the drum now to the meeting you and I wherein yesterday we're talking about this issue,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:12:01,but if it's just about rounding up kids and bringing bringing them to the Reporting Center,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:12:08,or to the truancy Center it's not going to deal with the washing machine,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:12:13,it's not going to deal with the cyber bullying it's not going to deal with the fact that they only have one or two uniforms,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:12:19,to wear and it's not going to deal with those other issues and why can't I say that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:12:24,because we did it before now I know there's always comeback it doesn't mean that you don't do it again,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:12:29,and do it now but to Mr madis points is that this has to be a deeper dive than a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:12:36,move to say we're going to address an issue that Miss Clark and principals that put on the table we're going to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:12:41,address an issue that Community people have put on the table it has to be a deep dive because if not we're going to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:12:48,be here in another political cycle and somebody's going to be talking about this again and then Lastly lastly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:12:56,we talk about kids in New Orleans dropping out of high school New Orleans,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:13:01,is either at or has surpassed the national average for kids who are dropping out after the sixth grade,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:13:08,they're choosing to stay home that started before covet it's another,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:13:13,commentary thank you I don't see any further Council comments,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:13:20,I'll give my closing comments to be candid the reason why,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:13:25,this resolution is so important is because the reality is that a problem of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:13:31,this magnitude I'm not just talking about truancy I'm really speaking directly to a lot of the comments,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:13:37,the well heard and well-said comments by Miss Carter and by Mr Burnside is that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:13:42,you're talking about a systemic problem that neither the city council or the school board can solve on their own,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:13:48,because it's multi-tiered I mean the school board is tasked with those things,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:13:54,that are happening during school hours and the City of New Orleans is tasked with those resources outside of school,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:14:00,hours and this Council has repeatedly said from when we came in office,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:14:06,and I always hearken back to that First Community Development meeting that councilman King had in which we had that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:14:27,to the points that have been made here today this Council has recognized repeatedly that we have a systemic,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:14:33,problem in this city that even when things do work when a new Administration a new politicians come into the city,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:14:40,they obliterate all the work that happened before them and start over we have not built upon our successes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:15:25,this working group is to say let's identify all of the problems that exist,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:15:32,that have led to this problem let's identify the problems in the schools outside the schools the resources that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:16:18,Sustainable forward-thinking Solutions that will not exist in response to this crisis that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:16:25,will address the underlying issues permanently because the councilman Thomas's point we had solutions to these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:16:32,problems and we stopped funding them when the crisis passed and if we don't have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:18:01,extremely interested in and it provides an opportunity for us when we get such special orders to set specific times for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:18:08,those instruments that the public can be aware that's the time to show up for it so it simply expands the amount of times,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:18:15,that we can do that per quarter so that we can schedule in a way that allows those people who wish to participate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:18:21,that they'll know exactly what time they show up to participate that's what the rule does uh I don't see any public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:18:27,comment on the rule I will move to adopt the rule councilman,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:19:13,Orleans police and Justice Foundation recruitment programs are performance analysis of Police recruitment programs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:19:21,including a review of best practices and services gaps and recommended strategies,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:19:27,for improving recruitment efforts thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:19:33,I'm Clark this is a pretty straightforward issue as many of you know we have a tremendous recruitment problem in the City of New,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:19:39,Orleans regarding New Orleans police officers we have tried as a council both,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:19:45,this and other councils previously to try to both,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:19:51,solve that problem with nnopd as well as Outsourcing it to the New Orleans police and Justice Foundation to be candidate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:19:58,the results have been bad across the board um it's speaking to a lot of human,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:20:03,resource Representatives one thing the council has never done is truly do a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:20:09,comprehensive performance audit of all entities involved in recruiting to figure out why the recruiting is so bad,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:20:16,and to be candid it is it's bad we the numbers we get back is that you have as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:20:23,many as 3 000 individuals that were identified as being interested in being nopd officers and yet our recruitment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:20:30,classes hover around 20 individuals whatever is going wrong in this equation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:20:38,we need to have a third party come in audit our existing processes and figure,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:20:44,out what is the best best path forward whether that path forward is through nopd police and Justice or simply having,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:20:51,like made Apartments to across the country Professional Service organizations that are simply tasked,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:20:57,with recruiting efforts we don't know yet but until we have an audit to get an idea of what is working and not working,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:04,we can't take that step so the resolution simply creates the RFP to have individuals respond to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:11,do the audit of our existing recruitment Services that's what it does Mr druzo uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:16,thank you for bringing this councilmember Morrell I just wanted to say two things one is I think it's part of a broader concern not only uh with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:24,nopd she said recruiting and retention issues but also other agencies as well,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:30,and that is going to be literally the first line of questions that I have during the budget quarterly meetings is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:35,where are you on ftes if you don't have enough people we can't do the services of the people no matter what department,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:41,it is and also just I think we need to look hard at having a third party do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:46,this that I appreciate the work that others have done on this um but that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:52,people who have professional outfits to do recruiting and retention since we're competing nationally is important and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:58,last I think one of the public facing things we need to think about too is something like a recruit stat where,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:04,there is those whoever is doing this plus the administration actively showing people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:10,in real time where we stand and process I think that's important too so thank you for bringing this legislation thank,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:16,you councilman jeruso uh councilman Moreno oh sorry Thomas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:22,Rhino apologize I'll let Miss Moreno go first,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:27,thank you um councilmember jeruso just kind of adding on to what you were just talking about if if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:34,you know there's already a kind of a move,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:39,um occurring potentially to go to a third party I think it's really important then that we really start working on what is what does a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:46,transition plan look like because the last thing I want is to not have anything you know I don't want to end up,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:52,the cea for for nopjf is going to be back up in in July so I don't want to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:57,end up in a situation where in July we're trying to figure out how we're going to RFP something out and you know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:23:02,and whether we're going to keep like if if we're if if it appears that we may be transitioning to another path then we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:23:10,need to start working on that right now and get all of our ducks in a row and make sure that that we we bring in the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:23:16,right third party and and figure that piece out because if if we don't have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:23:21,everything together we don't have our ducks in a row we're going to end up in a worse position than we are now so I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:23:27,just wanted to to add that to it that we start working now on what that transition looks like thank you Mr,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:23:32,President my turn now,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:23:38,I want to Echo council member uh Jerusalem's comments uh since,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:23:43,councilmember green started his one-man labor uh human resources and and City and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:23:51,government Labor uh unit uh many of us have been recommending people uh sending,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:23:57,resumes uh people have been calling about Physicians and you know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:24:04,that's in the case but but publicly especially with this effort I think it has to be said uh no one that I know that has turned in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:24:12,a resume or responded to an opening has gotten a job yet,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:24:19,now I don't know and I think maybe uh councilmember Morrell this study could,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:24:25,help find out why right if you've you've asked to be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:24:32,the chief tiddlywink officer and your degree is in tiddlywinks,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:24:37,and you send your tiddlywink resume in and there's an opening there why have you not been interviewed or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:24:44,hired yet so there's something in the process that the customer Jerusalem's comments that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:24:51,are so it would not surprise me that if we can't hire people in the tiddlywinks,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:24:56,division uh quickly even when their resume lines up it's no wonder we can't put people in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:25:03,specialized divisions like like law enforcement so I think the most important thing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:25:08,about this is it will tell us where the material weaknesses are it will tell us whether if there's a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:25:14,breakdown in the system because since council member Eugene started this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:25:20,one-man Municipal hiring movement uh several people have applied several,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:25:26,people have sent resumes and I don't know of anyone that has been hired yet,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:25:33,so yeah and I know there's good intention on both sides so this is something that definitely needs to be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:25:39,improved and fixed because the jobs are there the budget is there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:25:45,the deed is there but the people aren't there yet,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:25:51,councilman green councilman Thomas and members of the Council of course I I do appreciate the fact that you all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:25:57,recognize my motivation and commitment to getting people to work for city government great jobs great benefits and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:26:04,retirement and health and the like but I do um say this and I look forward to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:26:10,this request for proposals but sometimes it's just too hard we make it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:26:15,too hard because of historic factors we make it too hard to get jobs with the city because there was pressure put on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:26:22,in the past and I hope that as part of this request for proposals process we recognize that sometimes you can state,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:26:29,that we're in a state of emergency and you need to make some sort of changes we're in a state of emergency relative,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:26:34,to hire and in certain areas we can't get Street work done we can't get the proper policing done we're having a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:26:41,problem hiring civilians to join the nopd so I know that this council is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:26:46,concerned and wants to see more people take those jobs as far as the police department is concerned I will say this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:26:52,to the members of the public who are watching um the New Orleans police department has been called the gold standard of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:26:58,constitutional policing by our district attorney I know the process may be hard but you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:27:03,have seven council members who are concerned that if you fill out an application and you don't feel that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:27:08,you've been treated fairly that you call us and give us your name and we'll follow up on it I want to encourage,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:27:14,applications for not just applying making sure that you're given the opportunity to take the civil service,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:27:20,exam which needs to be offered more often and that you are communicated with by the source that is responsible for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:27:26,communicating with you but please recognize that service in the New Orleans Police Department is a great,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:27:32,service for our citizens we have a top lot a top level Police Department that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:27:37,has made thousands of arrests without serious public concerns in many instances maybe four thousand arrests,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:27:43,last year two thousand for violent crimes and very few accusations of abuse,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:27:49,by the police the police are doing an outstanding job they respond in a proper manner and we're appreciative for their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:27:55,work so please apply and if you're not treated fairly contact one of our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:28:00,offices we'll help you thank you do we have any public comments okay uh just in closing a couple of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:28:07,points one at the council vice president Moreno's point I do believe that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:28:13,it is especially essential to have a bill of health on the existing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:28:19,recruiting process before we begin the process of potentially seeking a third party to do it because if we don't know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:28:25,what's going wrong or what's necessary in the current recruiting process it will it could possibly negatively,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:28:33,impact our ability to get another group to come in because they won't know what they're getting into Additionally the councilmember Green's point and I want,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:28:40,to be much more specific it is especially frustrating when you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:28:46,have successful recruitment efforts I know this Council has repeatedly pressed upon the need for civilianization as a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:28:54,solution because it is easier to get a civilian hired than it is a a normal police officer and for us to have over,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:29:02,150 applications for 50 positions that remain unfilled it's demoralizing to the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:29:10,city it's demoralizing the applicants because they've actually called it the process set an application in and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:29:16,they're simply waiting in a holding pattern and while we're publicly complaining that we are in a crisis when,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:29:22,people respond to the call they're being put on hold and that is that is not appropriate and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:29:30,certainly as those civilian positions are within the New Orleans Police Department I will make sure that as we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:29:37,have those rfps come in it includes those people who are in the process but simply aren't being hired,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:29:43,generally speaking when you look at success and recruitment when you talk to a third party,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:29:49,Headhunter organization they define success by a position is empty and it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:29:55,has been filled and I think that when you look at our recruitment efforts we give a pluses on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:01,the attempt not on the solution and if we are going to have somebody come in to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:06,come in here and say I'm going to be the new head hunting agency we should in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:11,that process of hiring them say we are going to incentivize you to put bodies in positions versus try real hard,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:20,so with that I move that I just want to respond to one of the things that you mentioned so I while I do think it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:26,important that you know we we figure out what's gone wrong the the problem with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:32,with an RFP is that by the time we finally get somebody in it's three months from now and then in July we've,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:38,got the new cea so I actually think we should be working kind of um in in parallel that figuring out,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:44,still a transition plan getting with no pjf and an OPD on whether or not they even want to continue doing a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:50,recruitment and if for some reason they don't start working on that transition plan so at the same time you know we'll,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:56,be just ready to go and also have the answers on the back end so I would just say that and I guess I would close by saying,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:02,until we know how bad a job they're doing I don't know whether I want their input I'll move to adopt the resolution,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:08,because I don't even want to do it anymore second by Mr Green please vote your machines,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

5:10:33,Thomas first of all I think uh you know as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:10:39,always uh I've been on the board of uh operation combat Christmas in October I've participated in raising funds to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:10:46,restore properties gotten young folk involved in understanding historical properties and his significance and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:10:52,conversations with uh uh lonesty line and Jack moriel about uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:10:59,being careful that we don't tear down structures in historical African-American communities that they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:11:05,deserve the right to be preserved too but there's some realities about New Orleans in the 1960s our population was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:11:12,about 630 000 right our population now is 391,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:11:19,000. so we actually have a a larger footprint,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:11:24,uh for people to live here that actually lives here we're about a few hundred thousand dollars people sure a few,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:11:30,hundred thousand people sure so when people talk about fixing properties even,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:11:35,if we fixed up every lot uh where people used to live and fix up every existing structure where people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:11:42,used to live guess what we don't have enough people to put into that footprint,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:11:47,so we'd actually not dealing with the reality of our situation yeah we have here but my question was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:11:54,and I think councilmember Moreno called it and council member I'm a council member Burnside I mean Mr Burnside Mr,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:12:01,Burnside I didn't mean to curse you like that and Mr Burnside was that so if there's a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:12:09,solution have we identified within that footprint where 680 000 or 630 000 people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:12:17,now where we have 200 391 000 and we identified significant infrastructures,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:12:22,that we want to save and we said well guess what we want to get uh get resources get Investments where we have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:12:30,to save these okay now now the the knowing that in terms of our historical significance in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:12:37,our culture this property is important is important we've identified funds,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:12:44,right we've earmarked City funds hdlc funds to make sure that this structure doesn't get torn down or neglected and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:12:52,if you talk about the process taking so long I mean you know I dealt with a property,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:12:57,that it wasn't 18 uh months it had been vacant for 12 years,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:13:03,so I think you can fit 18 months inside of 12. years and nothing still had been done where you could actually put your,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:13:09,hand through the property termites were eating it and it was about to fall on the the property that had just been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:13:16,rehabilitated you know Holy Cross District next door so the solution seems,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:13:21,to me I think the hdlc uh doesn't need to continue to be reactive,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:13:28,and maybe we could get come together and be proactive have we identified significant,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:13:34,structures that we we say look even though we only have 391 000 people in the city overnight we're not going to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:13:41,get another 230 or 40 000 but we shouldn't tear down this structure,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:13:47,this is one we need to come up with resources and Partnerships to save do we have that list,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:13:55,is that a question for me yes um I wouldn't say that we have a list per,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:14:01,se uh we have 18 local historic districts and the hdlc own does not have money to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:14:09,you know in our budget or as part of our mission to help offset costs of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:14:15,rehabilitating structures we work very closely with the Department of Code Enforcement to try to get targeted,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:14:22,properties to them so that their very rigorous code enforcement process which,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:14:27,we don't have that to their Tools in our toolbox so that they can identify properties and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:14:34,try to put them through the you know adjudication hearing process and then ultimately sold at share sale to people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:14:42,who are willing to rehabilitate these structures unfortunately that process as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:14:47,you know is quite slow and there are a lot of uh bottlenecks in that process,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:14:52,that we're all 10 20-year bottlenecks uh well this property was uh brought to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:14:59,code enforcement's attention in 2017 but no progress was ever made on their end,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:15:06,um and the hdlc has been citing it for demolition by neglect uh I would argue that the hdlc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:15:13,finds properties that are are blighted and we turn them over to code enforcement in an effort to try to get,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:15:21,these blighted properties remedied um so that they can be rehabilitated and turned back over to people who are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:15:27,interested in buying them I would say the Irish channel is an amazing example of those efforts and the success of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:15:33,doing that in a neighborhood full scale and the property values as a result have increased dramatically and so you know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:15:41,rehabilitations can pay off for Community yes we've identified the prod properties that are blighted yes we've,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:15:48,turned them over to code enforcement to try to get some movement and get them back into Commerce have we had great,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:15:54,success with that no would you like to fund us to you know give money to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:01,homeowners to make repairs on their properties that would be amazing but currently we don't have that in our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:07,toolbox uh property value increasing could be a double-edged sword I I don't disagree,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:14,I'm just saying that you know properties like this can and have been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:19,rehabilitated throughout the the years of the hdlc and I think to the city's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:25,betterment no look the hclc from uh Sandra Levy uh took with the PRC and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:30,Patty gay uh have been Noble and notable uh I mean when it fits when there's an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:37,opportunity through my history I've gotten pretty good marks there in in in sided with them most of the time but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:44,increasingly what we're seeing is these properties that have been around for decades that we say we we want to save,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:51,that are being them being demolished by neglect with no,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:58,pot of funds and no plan to rehabilitate them and how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:03,do we encourage people to move in a community our sticks or stay in a community right when there's this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:09,eyesore that not only affects their way of life next door but also as a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:14,disincentive for investment in that neighborhood moving forward so to me uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:21,a win that creates a lose-lose is not a win so my question is because I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:28,think we're going to be confronted with this more and more often is how do we work with you all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:35,to say here's a pot of funds here are properties that absolutely have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:40,to be saved council members mayor uh preservationists because XYZ lived here,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:46,it represents uh the culture and and everything that binds this community and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:52,this other stuff and I know I'm kind of believer in this but we've lost about point three percentage,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:59,point of population over the last several years after we peaked after Katrina,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:05,vocal exiting now again and and this property is an incentive,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:11,for people to want to relocate or populate that community so it's as as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:16,important as this property is how do we balance it where we can Landmark certain properties,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:23,because we have funds resources we've identified someone and these other properties we deal with them in a way,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:30,that create investment and growth and we haven't reached that point yet thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:36,Council vice president thank you I really appreciate this discussion because once again it's about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:43,coming up with Solutions and and and how we deal with the blight problem but yet,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:49,how do we keep up uh New Orleans a historical aspect right and and I'll say,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:54,this I'm actually familiar with with this property I I walk by it often because I take my dog over to Burke Park,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:00,he likes to go over there and you know it's a very well-known uh property all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:07,the neighbors know about anybody who walks by knows about it and uh it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:13,sticks out and I think everyone has always asked questions about it like well why doesn't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:19,somebody just buy it why doesn't somebody just rehab it and and it always seems to be the answer that it would,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:26,just be too expensive to try to rehab the property,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:32,um maybe it would be a different scenario if there could be a demo and you could build new so whether it's a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:38,developer trying to make some type of uh profit and building,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:43,um a home or rehabbing a home it would it was not going to be feasible and whether it was going to be let's say a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:49,homeowner wanting to move into the neighborhood to rehab it it wasn't really going to be feasible so then,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:56,unfortunately you all on the street have just been sitting there uh to the point,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:02,of where you're just now stuck and so no no doubt about it I mean I think we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:09,have to we have to really change our thinking as to how we deal with properties,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:15,um like this and whether it's some type of fund that we set up to assist homeowners,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:22,who are willing to take on this challenge but they're willing to move quickly so that you all don't have to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:27,live with a property like this but they are willing to rehab a very complicated property,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:33,um that that's something I think is worth really looking at and working through I mean I think it's a really good suggestion that was brought up by,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:40,by council member Thomas that maybe this could be a potential solution and then of course we'd have to figure out how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:45,much money do we put into the fund what's really workable but I'd like to work with hdlc on that to see if there's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:50,something that that could be worked out and and if to see if there are any any um procedures or models at other cities,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:59,um have that potentially could be workable for us as far as some type of fun to assist homeowners to deal with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:21:06,these types of properties but you know it's tough because ordinarily I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:21:12,I I lean toward being against um demos but uh and and so does,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:21:18,councilmember Harris but knowing this property and and seeing and understanding what,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:21:24,neighbors are going through and really the public safety situation around this particular property I do think it is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:21:31,appropriate to to demo it and give someone the opportunity to build something new and uh and hopefully not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:21:40,only of course for the betterment of this particular plot of land but for the betterment of the whole street thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:21:46,councilmember Harris council member Jerusalem well um the next item after this is mine and it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:21:52,the same issue um and I just want to speak to that because I think we're all affected by it I guess the other thing Nathan the point,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:21:59,you made is an excellent one which is the city has chronically underfunded code enforcement votes the tune of how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:22:06,many people are in Code Enforcement title research which takes 12 18 24,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:22:12,months longer than that people who can cycle through the minimum property maintenance cycle repeatedly as well and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:22:20,I guess I just want to remind everybody that we the council funded code enforcement for 20 million dollars too,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:22:26,over the next couple of years so my hope Miss Burke is um while that doesn't solve the problems,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:22:33,that we're confronted with today that part of the information that we're starting to get back both from code Code,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:22:39,Enforcement and from hdlc is that they're working together to try and preserve things as Mr a lot said so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:22:46,we're not getting to the point that it's essentially demolition by neglect because people have been waiting for so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:22:52,long and and there's no funds that can help on help them so um again I I hope the money that's in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:22:58,place that we should be tapping into right now starts to remedy this problem so council member Harris isn't faced,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:23:05,with this Hobson's choice thank you thank you um I know we have one online comment but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:23:10,let me just say this um I we're in an affordable housing crisis we have an abundance of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:23:16,properties that look like this scattered throughout our city so to have a Redevelopment framework where a property,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:23:23,is adjudicated quickly and given to an entity like Nora who can then turn it around to sell it to somebody who's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:23:30,going to rehab it for affordable housing I mean that's something that we really need to be thinking about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:23:35,we also need to think about whether or not we want to give the same sort of tax breaks to residential rehabbers that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:23:42,do to people who are doing that commercially and I think that's something that we need to work with our State Legislative tours,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:23:49,um to see if that's something we can do but I think absolutely if we can all get together in the same room and try to figure out a framework and what other,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:23:55,cities do council member Thomas councilman Moreno council member jerusal are all right we have the resources we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:24:03,have the will to do this and we have a crisis on our hands that we can solve with empty buildings that are falling,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:24:09,and deteriorating like this and we can do it while preserving our unique New Orleans history so thank you I'm going,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:24:16,to uh take the online comment and then I'll move this is from the applicant um Carol,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:24:21,McCarthy I'm unable to attend today's meeting I'd like to speak about the property at 815 3rd Street neighbors,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

6:22:17,which is that we not leave mixed-use areas out of the conversation about short-term rentals because the idea that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:22:24,mixed-use zones are somehow separate from our neighborhoods is a joke um case in point uh I like to think that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-Tv5yuUTw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
