2:19:03,ruling thank you thank you Mr McGuire,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:15,good afternoon everybody my name is Sheamus McGuire I live at a 3922 Perrier Street in the Toro area I'm a licensed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:22,architect here in New Orleans I own the the co-owner of the firm cicada here in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:28,New Orleans as well where we actually do a lot of historic uh preservation and historic Rehabilitation I'm actually in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:34,favor of the demo application for this I'm one of I think the 21 individuals who emailed uh Leslie about this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:42,um I really come here just to kind of give my professional opinion as an architect I mean um this particular,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:49,property uh as the applicants have noted has,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:54,the the architectural elements that we really look to define a historic fabric of our neighborhood has,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:00,they no longer ultimately exist um this particular corner store typology,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:05,has been greatly uh modified actually if you go down let's go down keep going keep going,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:12,to there um so I think on the far left was kind,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:17,of the original ultimate based on the Sanborn and the early or the late 1800s the corner store typology,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:24,res or since then over time ultimately the front porch was closed in Side Porch,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:30,was closed in and then it's kind of been ultimately butchered as far as you know the windows that had,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:37,been placed on the front facade um and and rendering It ultimately from a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:43,architectural typology unrecognizable in addition to the blight Etc I think one other thing that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:50,should think about here and hdlc doesn't take this into account but in order for the homeowners to renovate this properly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:57,their current home is actually under uh the base flood elevation in the city so even if they were to remove the back end,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:03,the existing front area is below BFE which would require a decent amount of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:09,um cost to either raise that to the the base flood elevation and or build a rear Edition where they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:16,would have to have steps into it which renders it quite costly so ultimately,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:21,I'm here in support for the demo um and that's all I have thanks Mr McGuire uh Mr Burnside,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:42,me and the New Order are not necessarily going to get along that well but anyway whatever,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:48,um I'm gonna do something I don't normally do and because I'm going to do that I'm going to extend my apologies first of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:53,all to the owners of 740 uh Jenna Street um I don't have any problem with their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:22:00,demoing at all and I just put in a card after Mr Cole spoke,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:22:06,um so I'm only going to take a minute or so to basically say something I never expected to say in my life which is I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:22:12,happen to agree with Mr Coleman it's not so much pennies and dollars,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:22:18,ultimately is his fairness and democracy the rich and the poor treated alike in a democracy that's fading because we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:22:24,have juridical people and you can birth juridical people by the thousands if you have enough money and they can all make,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:22:31,contributions to all the campaigns you want but still the rich human being who's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:22:37,embodied in a human body by a Creator God can only vote once just like I can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:22:43,only vote once and it is my experience that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:22:48,significantly large expensive pieces of property are in fact treated differently by the city than small less expensive,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:22:54,pieces of property the plaza Tower I believe it is called,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:00,is the skyscraper across the street from the union passenger train station The netting that was put up after some metal,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:06,fell off and almost hit a bicyclist is itself now ripped visually and obviously ripped on two of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:12,its corners the city or someone put up some orange barricades to stop cars from driving,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:17,that way but we being New Orleans moved the barricades and drove that way anyway so as we interact with the rich and the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:25,poor understand the perceived fairness might be almost as important as real fairness,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:32,if the poor really do believe the rich have access to lives that they cannot even hope for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:38,do not be surprised that they are angry and feel cheated thank you Mr Burnside council member,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:44,Morrell thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:49,I have to concur with Mr Burnside on a couple of his points I think and I appreciate the council as a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:56,deliberative body and our process and doing these reviews I'm going to say something that is going to make my,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:02,preservationist friends kind of probably have a minor seizure old does not mean historic,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:07,and I think oftentimes when people see things that are old they go well it's old so it must have some special,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:14,historic significance on one hand I think that it diminishes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:20,true historic buildings when you lump in stuff like that and go well it's old so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:26,I guess it's historic when you look at truly historic properties that stood there for some kind of purpose,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:33,to Mr burnside's point I completely concur one of the things that I can tell you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:40,about the plaza Tower in particular because now we're talking about that is that not only is that kind of lighted,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:48,half volume apart structure kind of symbolic of the dysfunction of the City of New Orleans but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:55,to my point old doesn't mean historic as it sat there rotting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:01,because we did not deal with it at the appropriate time it qualified to be on a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:07,federal registry as a historic property limiting the options of the city to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:12,enforce how we're going to deal with Plaza Tower and developers do that with very large properties because when they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:19,hit that number when they are qualified to register and go in historic registers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:25,they're eligible for historic tax credits cities Across the Nation this city in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:30,particular get lulled this idea that it's all about the financing on these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:36,larger projects you have to give us more time we need special treatment to get this done,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:42,and just like you have a neighborhood in support today of turning that into a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:49,home I think that the business community in the downtown area the taxpayers let's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:57,see New Orleans are tired at staring at a blighted building that there's apparently no plan for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:03,so be candid I have a bit I am triggered whenever I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:09,see the barricades go up around Plaza Tower and the streets close because it might fall on somebody,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:15,like personally as a citizen the City of New Orleans but more importantly to Mr burnside's point we charge people with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:21,closed streets are we charging the owners of Plaza Towers when we have to barricade off,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:27,downtown New Orleans so far still building and fall on people who's paying for the people that are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:34,injured by the falling parts or I think we have a council staff who had a part of lots of tower fall in their car,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:41,everyone should be treated equally old doesn't mean historic and I think it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:47,is entirely appropriate that you be given the opportunity to make something into a home that right now isn't serving,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:54,your community and does not from anything I've seen should have any,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:27:06,thank you council member Morrell I think we can all agree on this diet sub Plaza Tower needs to be addressed by the owner,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:27:12,and by the city and that we need better mechanisms of enforcement and charging the owners of lighter properties,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:32:07,but it was just for ambulances and I think one thing that we heard,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:32:13,clearly yesterday from the community was that there is pain as council member,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:32:18,morale said yesterday about the issues with crime and Public Safety but also a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:32:23,lack of urgency so what can we be doing as both a city and as a council to help,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:32:37,Public Safety agencies at the procurement process will be much faster and because of the state of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:32:44,emergency that we're in because we don't have to go through the normal channels and delay and get bogged down and that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:41:09,City's giving away a conditional use that basically is money otherwise the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:15,events would be different right the city needs housing okay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:21,now either the city does need housing or it doesn't if it doesn't then I should be told politely and private just to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:27,shut up and go away but if the city does need housing the city needs to start thinking of innovative new methods to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:34,achieve housing and we would like our housing to be Diversified into good communities not just all lumped together,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:40,in one ghetto somewhere so as we do these conditional uses and it doesn't matter what they're for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:46,we need to see them as an opportunity for the city to start saying hey,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:51,give us one or two affordable units somewhere make this work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:58,some of these buildings are open only 12 hours a day seven days a week which,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:42:04,means they're closed and locked and nobody's there half the time I'm here to tell you that's harmful to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:42:46,not trying to tell people how to live I'm saying the city itself needs to start thinking of these conditional uses,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:42:51,as an opportunity to engage in trade negotiation with a person who wants something which is the conditional use,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:02:48,thank you very much any other questions for Mr Washington and Mr Washington that's my thought as well is that the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:02:54,court can determine whether or not we decided correctly or not depending on how the vote goes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:03:13,good afternoon Council good afternoon um this is just an unfortunate uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:03:19,time that I'm experienced through my small business ventures,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:03:25,I have a relationship with Waters up to 20 years,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:03:31,and in my heart of hearts I know he he wasn't behind his pulley this was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:03:37,more I think his wife than he so uh happy life happy wife,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:03:46,I don't have really much anything else to say about this thank you Mr Gan,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:03:52,um Allie Conley,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:04:05,good afternoon council members I'm here to speak um in favor of you all adopting this ordinance,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:04:11,um as has been stated this is a request by the owner and I think councilmember Harris you cut right to the point right,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:04:17,to the legal issue all of this other stuff is kind of extraneous to what the council needs to act on today the czo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:04:24,says that once there's been a request by the owner um it has to be accepted by the council,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:04:29,um I had notes on you know all of the various ways that the tenant in this case is violating the lease and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:04:36,violating the conditional use permit um one point I did want to make is that Mr Washington has stated that this is an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:04:43,attempt to circumvent the judicial process it's two separate things the judicial process process has to deal,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:04:49,with an eviction specific to this tenant what the property owner is asking the council to do is what would be specific,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:04:55,to the property because the experience has been so negative that the property owner doesn't want to go through this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:05:01,ever again so we're asking the council to to approve this measure thank you thank you Mr Waters,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:05:16,and there's Robert Waters 4212 Magazine Street um the one of the owners of Charter,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:05:22,property is the owner of the property in 2021 we applied for a conditional use,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:05:28,permit for the property which was granted for a retail wine store and and I had visited a number of wine stores,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:05:34,prior to doing this and had seen places that sold bottles of wine and sold retail and had a small tasting area as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:05:41,permitted by the czo and when we applied for the conditional use contained in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:05:49,that was the limitation as to where the tasting room was going to be it's limited to 15 of the retail space,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:05:55,and it was a room with doors and and we thought that this would be just fine what we ended up with was a bar and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:06:04,three nights a week the home that we live in Above This Bar is uninhabitable,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:06:11,um there is there are televisions there's a sound system there are people drinking throughout the premises we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:06:18,objected to this Behavior within a week of it opening and sat down with Troy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:06:23,Gannon and said this is not in the czo terms this is not in your conditional use you must modify it in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:06:31,the end he said if I modified I can't stay in business I said well we can't live like this and this has continued,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:06:37,since June of 2021 and it's not my wife it is the two of us,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:06:45,the restaurants in the area do very well out of our having have a late dinner three nights a week outside but when I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:06:52,was recovering from covid three weeks ago I had to stay inside and it is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:06:58,unbearable you have to wear noise canceling headphones you have to turn up your own sound system and until 10,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:07:03,o'clock 10 15 when people clear up it's horrible and that's why we're asking for revocation not to have this happen again,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:07:10,thank you thank you Mr Waters Mr Smith,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:07:22,good afternoon Council uh thanks for the opportunity to speak Zach Smith Zach Smith Consulting 530,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:07:28,South Norman C Francis not paid to be here on this particular project uh with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:07:34,our professional office we look at a lot of these projects as they come through and this one of course jumped off the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:07:39,page whenever you see an owner asking to rescind something that's an entitlement to their own property uh from my decade,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:07:47,Plus in enforcement we would have loved to see more landowners take the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:07:54,initiative when there are issues that they feel are violating the trust violating what was approved to take it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:00,in their own hands to come and ask the city to voluntarily and willfully take that back uh it's absolutely a rarity,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:07,because again it's not what people generally do they get through this day in day out they get through the initial,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:13,vote you never see from them again landlords on residential landlords and Commercial taking that initiative it's a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:19,rare thing and it should be applauded um and so it's as somebody who's seen it from both side sides of this sort of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:26,story again it's it's refreshing in its own way I can't speak at all to any of the litigation I have no dealings with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:32,any of that but at the end of the day it's uh very hard to take somebody you know putting myself in the owner's shoes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:38,if they were projected to where they had to call the city on themselves to enforce you know that uh the way,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:44,enforcement sometimes works it starts looking at other properties starts looking at other things and it might potentially start uh you know looking at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:51,all these properties somebody doing the right thing to take it in their own hands and bring the city uh in this way,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:08:56,I think is a is the perfect way to do it from a truly land use way thank you thank you Miss Mr Spears,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:09:05,okay Mr Spears,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:09:31,um to cut to the chase I agree with what I've heard that the property owner has,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:09:36,the right to ask for a rescission of the conditional use permit but just to push,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:09:42,back on some of the rhetoric that I've heard from attorney Washington these are two separate proceedings uh the eviction,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:09:49,has been going on for some time there have been dilatory motions filed they've been avoidance of service of process and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:09:56,there's been no ruling by the court that indicate that the rich is improper but the eviction is based on violating not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:10:03,just the terms and conditions of the conditional use per permit but also violating the terms of the lease which,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:10:09,include maintaining insurance which include who's following uh the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:10:15,guidelines of the conditional use permit uh Mr Waters and his wife during covet sold their home they live on top of this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:10:23,property so they're experiencing firsthand what's going on they're seeing people drinking in the the wine shop,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:10:31,outside the wine shop they're hearing the loud noise the loud music all hours,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:10:37,of the day and night they see people serving and drinking high content alcohol which is a clear violation of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:10:44,the wine shop so we're here to ask to urge that this Council follow the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:10:50,recommendations of City Planning and the motion of council member Leslie Harris in a law this property to never be a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:10:58,wine shop again we may find some other great use as an art gallery or something else but we do not want this property to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:11:04,ever be a wine shop again because what has happened is actually converted to a ballroom in a nightclub and that's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:11:10,unfair to everyone else who's following the rules and it absolutely puts Mr Waters out of risk of his other,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:11:17,responsible businesses being placed in Jeopardy because he's allowing violations to happen on his Magazine,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:11:24,Street property thank you Mr Spears any questions for Mr Spears Mr council member Thomas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:11:31,uh first of all thank you and councilmember Harris to thank you City Planning I always heard that politics,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:11:37,made for strange bedfellows uh see wine bars do uh also uh now you know I think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:11:45,the relocation process uh is clear but the only thing that I was concerned about was as someone who doesn't drink,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:11:51,but who's a patron here uh as someone uh who doesn't drink uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:11:56,but has been to Danielle Metz uh meetings about social justice for women of incarceration throughout this country,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:12:02,uh where women came from all over the country to use that business and the conversations we've had with many social,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:12:09,justice organizations at that location about race about economic equity in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:12:15,Perry parody and it's someone who used to represent that area I think I know a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:12:20,few people in in that area and when I first heard of the differences here with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:12:25,all respect to Mr Waters is his property I had not heard uh anything uh from any,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:12:32,of the folks who have to live in the area our own business of the area as a matter of fact there are people with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:12:37,few times that I would be there would come from the restaurants to actually stop there and you know there's a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:12:44,certain level of classism within our communities uh that are real and I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:12:50,always thought it was interesting the African-American attorneys and uh those who represented a lot of businesses who,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:12:56,would be there having conversations about uh Community not just social justice but uh how we move forward here,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:13:03,so I always enjoyed that location and never saw anything out of hand so the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:13:09,thing that I'm mindful of is especially being respectful of the revocation uh process is that we don't tarnish uh the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:13:17,name uh we don't turn this a reputation of a business uh men and women,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:13:23,especially when we're trying to increase opportunities especially in the minority Community I don't need the height to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:13:29,highlight what the disparities here here again uh black men and women are at the bottom we're at the bottom in terms of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:13:36,uh our Latin brothers and sisters uh the Asian community and per capita income uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:13:43,as as well as white so I would hope that you know maybe at some point this conversation could just be about the law,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:13:49,and the revocation process and rep reputations don't have to be damaged,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:13:55,especially in a community that says too much damage already but the other thing that I do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:14:01,understand not being a lawyer but working with all you great lawyers and being around the law a little a little,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:14:07,bit the revocation process uh actually gives grants the tenant an opportunity,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:14:12,uh so that the court could deal with the hardship your financial or lease at some,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:14:18,point so it's kind of crazy in many ways that the best thing for the tenant is to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:14:23,actually get this lease revoked so that the courts could take care of the rest of it and that's my is is not a real lawyer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:14:31,that's just me talking you play one of them TV we heard from some of the best lawyers yeah thank you thank you council,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:14:55,that law so if a court wants to come and tell us that we're wrong then a court can do so um but at this point in time I'm going,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:20:53,let's be really really vague I've had ongoing interactions with the city,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:20:59,council and others in regards to Gordon Plaza and those interactions with Gordon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:05,Plaza the emphasis has been on that particular 67 properties and the fact that they are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:12,located on what used to be a city landfill,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:18,done quite a bit of work on that issue including reading most if not actually,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:23,all of the publicly available pieces of paper generated by,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:28,the federal EPA and buried in some of the reports or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:33,various maps showing the location of various poisons including the poison of lead,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:39,among others the maps are somewhat interesting to people who like Maps because they have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:45,abrupt edges they are cut off right at the fence line of the property,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:51,which means that officially speaking nobody has gone to test the other side,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:57,of the fence nobody in all this moral anguish has gone to see what poisons exist 100 yards,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:07,away from the property line of what used to be the agriculture Street landfill,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:16,the various reasons for that I suppose uh but the EPA reports made clear that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:22,most of the poisons that we are dealing with in our discussions about Gordon Plaza,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:30,where the result of burning at an incinerator,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:36,construction waste specifically wood that have been covered in lead paint and that that would have been burnt,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:42,there for decades so while we focused on the landfill and what is buried there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:48,I would suggest that the surrounding neighborhood should morally speaking be tested by the city,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:55,for lead levels thank you very much thank you Mr Burnside for your question I mean for your comments I appreciate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:23:20,familiarity of my dad talking to you about Carver all the time uh I will say this might be the only instance in which,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:23:34,commission's efforts to try and avoid confusion I do think it's interesting that if we were to call it Ram's way,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:23:42,there's the Los Angeles Rams which are the LA Rams which it's also kind of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:23:47,confusing anyway so I think either way we're going to have an adjustment period as those people along that route have to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:23:55,deal with the name change but so this Mr burnside's argument hopefully they'll be a mix of development based upon previous,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:24:02,uses of the property because a lot of that area needs a tremendous amount of work in Redevelopment it may be having,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:24:09,the city reassess property over there have it look at it out we'll tell you that in my experience as a legislator,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:24:18,in all of our older communities we have challenges with lead because of paint and other and other issues and I do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:24:24,think the city should do more the test neighborhoods and test areas and make sure people are aware of what lead,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:24:30,levels are so we appreciate you bringing that to our attention every time thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:29:18,rental without a CPC hearing or Council approval this is a glaring example of why the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:29:25,commercial Str model does not work and quite the opposite this model shows how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:29:31,commercial short-term rentals eat up lots that could be dedicated to affordable housing that is desperately,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:29:37,needed especially in the Central City community and we will keep this in mind as we begin creating new short-term,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:29:44,rental regulations this is a missed opportunity and extremely disappointing and I'm seeking,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:30:09,some comments and we also have comment cards so let's go with the public comment Maxwell,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:20,um thank you councilmember Harris for bringing this I know we've been working with your office on this for a minute and really appreciate that it's been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:25,something we've been advocating for since 2015 or 2016 when we first started talking about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:30,um inclusionary zoning we always wanted homeownership to be a part of it because we knew they were developers who were,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:36,eager to do this and and if we had developers eager to build affordable for sale housing we should make it as easy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:42,as possible in our zoning code um I also just want to say though that I think this is an important step but it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:48,not going to solve the problem of sort of unregulated short-term rentals in commercial zones,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:54,um and I know I already spoke to senior staff about this who's been great but it really underscores for us why we can't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:00,leave commercial and mixed-use zones out of this short-term rental law rewrite right the CPC staff unfortunately just,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:07,did in their report so it's really up to y'all to correct that um I think central city in particular,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:13,but there are plenty of other places in the city that are especially susceptible to this because so much of it is zoned,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:19,mixed use um and and I know there were boosters in that article who suggested that this would spur economic development but the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:26,research shows otherwise that short-term rental guests especially in black and brown neighborhoods don't spend money,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:31,there they just Uber to the French Quarter and leave coded racist reviews about how the neighborhood is ghetto or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:37,sketchy that's not what I want in our neighborhoods I'm sure that's not what you want in our neighborhoods,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:42,um and so my fear is that if we don't put those limits in the commercial zones as well we're going to seem the same,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:48,spillover effect we saw in the Treme from the French Quarter ban but this time it's going to be into mixed-use,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:53,neighborhoods that are you know right on the edge of our residential areas so I really appreciate you taking this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:59,step and we'd love to work with all of your offices to make sure that we include some new regulations on on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:32:05,Commercial short-term rentals as well on this rewrite thank you thank you Maxwell Mr Burnside,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:32:19,I hope the councilwoman May extend me an extra minute because I suspect I might go over a little bit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:32:25,um the problem with short-term rentals is the dream and the practice are very far apart,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:32:57,is it's turned into a nightmare so however beautiful the dream we have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:33:03,to look at the practice and the practices essentially we have hotels that are horizontal instead of vertical and they use cars instead of elevators,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:33:09,that's what we've got a bunch of hotels and the hotels going vertical or chewing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:33:15,up the land I've got three short-term rentals on the 2200 block of Felicity one's been there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:33:56,the other short-term rental has no person living in it at a regular basis it's an empty house,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:04,until somebody chooses to pay the owner to live in it for a short period of time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:10,I am blessed that that owner is a New Orleans resident she is not a corporation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:17,she is accessible and if I have a problem I can contact her,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:22,these short-term rentals aren't going to meet any of those criteria,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:29,and once again we don't even have one house in the block that's dedicated to affordable housing because we can't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:35,negotiate with these money people who come in to make more money in our economy because they don't understand,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:35:43,um this is something that we have been working on together is a priority that we have said it as a community for a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:35:49,number of years and I'm sad that it took the bad thing happening to get us to the place where we can finally move in a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:35:55,good direction we are glad and grateful that the council is not sitting back and watching this happen and is moving,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36:02,forward with a policy that would prevent this very thing from happening moving forward and uh and and thoughtfully and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36:11,and putting together continue to build the system that we need here in New Orleans to guarantee housing for all so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36:18,I'm I'm and I didn't introduce myself I'm so sorry I'm Andre nickamars executive director of housing Nola and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36:24,um we are here to support this motion these two motions um because this is a this is an issue,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:36:38,inspiring and supporting development the development that meets the needs of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36:43,people of New Orleans the math is really quite simple half the people who live here can't afford to live here that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36:51,means that the tour of the issues of Tourism can no longer prioritize and drive the economy in a way where we are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36:58,slitting the throats of this city in the long run and we have gotten to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:04,unfortunately we have gotten to that place where simple math around profits,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:10,regardless of whether or not that profit is long-term when you look at a project like this you know that this is a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:18,project that in the long run is going to cause more harm than good and frankly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:23,cause though whoever ends up playing the game of hot potato of owning these homes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:29,uh will someone will lose while the Neighbors in Central City will lose,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:34,while the people of New Orleans will lose those developers those owners will also lose long term so we thank you all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:40,for introducing this motion thank you so much councilwoman Harris for introducing this motion and moving this forward,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:46,thank you thank you Miss Morris are there any any online comments I didn't think so uh council member Thomas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:52,uh to councilman Harris I think uh District B has been the the lab uh today when you talk about test cases,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:59,whether it's revocation of zoning applications that have been applied for uh how we deal with bait and switch,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:06,uh in the uh uh short arm redo slash affordable housing uh Community uh this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:15,is really kind of common we've seen this with developers whether they uh set up affordable housing and then eventually,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:22,put people out because their property value was in a place that they could do market rate rent we've seen uh that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:28,happen uh we we have seen where developers actually uh put property in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:33,certain communities and then they would then would apply for subsidies from a federal government so I think this gives,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:39,us an opportunity to take a holistic look at how we manage that Community but there's another side to this also and I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:46,think we have to be mindful of it uh many uh small business people African-Americans specifically uh and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:53,many of whom we know I've used this as an opportunity I think who have followed the rules to make sure they can pay uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:01,Rising uh tax costs uh so that they could use the extra income to stay in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:07,communities that they've been driven out so uh we have to be as we move forward with uh rules and regulations I think we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:14,have to be my but it also I think I've uh remember some old zoning stuff we used to do uh back in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:20,the day that I'm sure is appropriate now is how do we use covenants and title restrictions to make sure that we don't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:27,have uh Peyton switched to make sure that when you apply for something uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:32,what's on the title and what's on the restrictions what's on the covenants uh prohibits you or you would lose uh your,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:38,right and uh I would also think that moving forward and I know councilmember Morrell is taking a holistic look at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:45,this piece those developers are owners uh who have shown a practice of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:51,violating we need they need to be flagged when you know who they are and we may,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:57,not be able to prohibit them with it within the law if the land use permits but we can also we can also acknowledge,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:04,them and highlight them as they try to get other permits to do the same but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:10,District B test case today thank you I hate to be a test case council member,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:15,Morrell thank you um I really appreciate councilman Harris,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:21,taking the lead on this issue and exposing a problem that's existed in this city for a lengthy period of time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:28,and it is that we allow people to come in under the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:34,guise of perform of providing affordable housing we roll out the red carpet to them and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:42,if they can manipulate the process to their benefit financially,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:48,they will use that process to maximize profit I I will go ahead and I will say,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:54,specifically the instance we all think of American can you had a massive Redevelopment project,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:01,in the middle of mid city that was Herald at the time as a model for the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:07,entire country the day to the day that that 10-year,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:12,requirement was up you had people who had not missed a rental payment ever who,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:18,were told get the hell out I can sell this I can rent this property at market rate get the hell out and I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:24,will find someone that'll rent it and these were people weren't causing any problems we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:30,paying their rent we're minding their business but the moment you incentivize developers and they know there's a way,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:36,that they can maximize profit and pretend like they care about little people they will do it this property is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:43,also a great example of that when this initial property was pitched as I understand it was pitched as an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:48,affordable housing Bonanza would be a great thing for the city and quiet has kept the moment the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:55,numbers didn't work they sold to someone else who wants to do short-term rentals we as a city and not to the City of New,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:03,Orleans I'm going to call it the Industrial Development board when you have groups like The Industrial,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:09,Development board that give away taxpayer dollars and you have Bad actors,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:16,they need to be held to account that if you take public dollars to do a project,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:21,and you get caught not meeting the criteria you set stop giving them more,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:28,Industrial Development board incentives councilmember Harris you've got a wall,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:35,up for a drive Shack in your District a wall and the same people that did that wall,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:42,found a new company to go try and build a new wall there and there wasn't even a consideration by,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:50,the Industrial Development board as the same people the same group of people who,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:55,sold them on a piece of property four years ago as they came back there was no,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:00,one to say let's check the receipts for a second because we tied up a whole lot of money in a whole lot of effort on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:06,something that didn't work out now to be clear I think the vision from,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:11,my perspective or this Council for commercial strs the customer Thomas's point is that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:17,they really should be an accessory used to a commercial property if you have a business that's an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:22,existing business and you want to put an Str above your business,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:27,and that's going to help your business make sense that's worth talking about but what we've seen from commercial,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:33,rentals is they don't do that they take an apartment building they kick everyone,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:39,out and turn it into a short-term rental they say they're going to build affordable town homes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:45,and they kicked them out to make short-term rentals those are not commercial short-term rentals those are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:52,Mega residential short-term rentals that could have been affordable housing so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:58,even though it was outside the purview of the city planning report the council is taking a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:05,serious look at commercial short-term rentals the reason why it's not being treated,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:10,with the same urgency necessarily is the residential is because we are under the gun of a federal a federal judgment to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:17,get that done on a fixed date but we will address commercial short-term rentals because as long as we make it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:24,easy for people to come in this city to buy up affordable rental units or to build,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:32,something that could be affordable rental units to displace neighbors and displaced communities,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:38,if we don't curb commercial rentals in a reasonable way they will just be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:43,rezoning property to commercial to the same Devastation they've already done neighborhoods,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:48,so thank you Mr Burnside as always for your comments they're on point and Max,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:54,we are not done with commercial short-term rentals thank you council member Teresa yeah I just wanted to Echo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:00,what councilmember Thomas said at the beginning which is a constant struggle when people ask for changes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:07,um we are confronted with bait and switch frequently and how do we deal with that and I think the idea of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:13,eliminating that Prospect through a vehicle like this is important and I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:18,also agree with what Miss Morris said as well which is when you incentivize,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:24,profit that allows things to um become more expensive and then,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:30,thereby pushing people out then you can't create affordable housing or Workforce housing as a result and also,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:39,right that people suffer not only short-term but also in the long term as she said that when you try to maximize,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:46,in in areas uh profit as opposed to allowing people to be able to afford to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:53,rent or buy there and then last to council member Morrell's point I thought you might be headed here to JP which is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:59,I I don't understand if we're talking about affordable housing and all these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:46:04,metrics that we want to work behind why we can't find tax structures that make,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:46:10,it much better to do that we do pilots for these huge things why can't we be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:46:16,doing that on a smaller scale for fewer units and saying instead of the 10-year,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nro7f26oEo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
