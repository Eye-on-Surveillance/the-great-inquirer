1:40:31,our biggest challenge is that there's seem to be not enough handshaking between,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:40:37,the different agencies and departments we still have to do a lot of land work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:40:42,to coordinate and get things done um give you a case in point we've been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:40:48,trying to um get a hold of our enforcing on no,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:40:53,parking zones for for an example um and over the years has been a challenge,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:01,um and to the point that this year I we've had to meet several different calls and several,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:07,different departments to just get uh so to give an example like we're doing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:13,Mardi Gras we would see a team of tow trucks come through and tow cars away,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:19,but in our community we may get two tow trucks so what we have is what we consider sometimes would be a public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:25,safety where you'll have people and vehicles in an area where it should be just pedestrians so those are the kind,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:32,of things that in the future we would like if all the Departments or whoever were in charge of all the things that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:38,when we submit into to one stop that we could have a sit down where we can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:44,express our concerns and then from the city Side they can explain to us those things in which we're required to do so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:50,as a whole we at the end of the day this the council does get the support from the city,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:55,but in the future we would like it so it would be that it's more of a sit down and I can't speak for other uh cultural,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:03,festivals but I assume they're going to probably have they're having those same challenges where the the organization,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:09,who is sponsoring their event it should be some kind of interaction of a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:14,personal interaction versus you're just filling out an application and you're submitting it in so but again we thank,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:22,you for all the support from all the city agencies uh but that would be our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:27,only um ask uh if there's a way in the future even with this event that those agencies,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:33,that touch our event is a way that we get somehow uh meet as a whole,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:39,thank you thank you Michael councilmember Thomas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:44,the first of all I want to thank the Chiefs executive director Mr uh Fairley,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:49,uh it's unfortunate uh uh Big Brother very chief that we're revisiting this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:56,again um I specifically remember the last time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:02,the Mardi Gras in our culture was challenged uh by folk who either didn't know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:08,a folk who worked with City and City agencies who didn't respect I understand that it was right here,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:16,in this building we're one of the greatest Chiefs gave his life uh for the culture,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:23,so that the city would understand how important this economic this cultural engine is you know behalf of my family,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:31,uh uh the late Big City Food and low cars my cousin Romeo uncle benny and all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:39,of the Great Men Who stand here if it weren't for the Mardi Gras Indians if it wasn't for this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:45,organization I would hate to see where we would have been during that time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:52,when you guys mediated and put together meetings to educate people from the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:57,police department and different city agencies and I remember some elected,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:02,officials who didn't understand uh you know riding wooden suits uh Riley,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:10,did it on Sunday and educating them so it's unfortunate that we're here to get,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:15,here again and but council member Harris thank you for bringing this before us the city has a office of cultural,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:23,I miss I know Mr Alexis is over the office of culture and you know maybe we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:29,need to Pro you know everybody we keep proposing stuff maybe one of the main things we need to propose is for anybody,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:36,who works for the city or represent the city ought to know the city,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:42,maybe you need to know why we have certain cultural certain rituals uh you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:50,know you know and there's nothing against because Iran is a city we love for we love the folk who adopt us but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:56,adopt our culture too but maybe one of the things missing is that we have too many people in important places,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:03,who think they hit a babysit us not to be one of us,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:08,and no disrespect to anybody but for anyone who would know especially in a critical agency they should have been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:15,prepared for this time already Mr Fairley they should have had somebody on point,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:20,already that's what you fought for that's what the chief Judy died for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:25,that's what stopped that movement two decades ago,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:31,so councilmember Harris I know one of the main events is is in your District Maybe,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:37,uh we need to propose something so that there's somebody year round,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:44,preparing for an event that's been happening for decades that's part of our culture where y'all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:51,should have to guess but when we get submit to one stop you go to an individual,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:57,to make sure they don't stop making sure the event happens so I don't know how we would do that in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:46:04,the form of a resolution of whatever because I you know uh but maybe at some,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:46:09,point we can work with the office of cultural address so that there's someone designated to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:46:15,work with the Chiefs to work with Mr Brown so that you know how are you gonna run,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:46:21,into this issue with one of the greatest uh New Orleans events in the history of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:10:58,but he was committed to the point where he could have taken his marbles after the storms that happened after the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:11:04,floods and gone somewhere else to do some other things but he hands on reinvested in his,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:11:10,properties there and in the community and many times we have criticisms of landlords that are Justified,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:11:19,because they don't do the right thing but you're not going to be able to find WT verges companies being criticized for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:11:27,not managing their properties correctly yes with any multi multi-faceted real,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:11:34,estate development arm you'll find something but I will tell you we was very Hands-On and when there was a need,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:11:39,to address the concern at his property he did so how do I know my company Nationwide real estate Corporation was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:11:46,involved with the management at the time and sometimes with Wade Burgess Wade Burgess was committed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:11:52,um to that community and how interesting it was that when the lights got,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:11:58,put up at Joe Brown this year Wade's turn with us came to an end but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:04,he saw that through and he was a great investor he was a great person to know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:11,and I think that at his funeral the song that you played as he left was very,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:18,symbolic of who Wade Burgess is his casket was being moved from the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:24,front to the rear the song that was played was I Did It My Way by Frank Sinatra and Wade Burgess did it his way,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:31,because if you had looked at some of the other factors that other developers look at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:37,some of those numbers might have come up and said you know don't reinvest there don't buy another shopping center Wade,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:44,verges very quietly even Finance deals for others yeah yeah right not too many,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:49,people know about that but very honestly because he was quiet about that but he financed deals for others apartments,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:55,that are instilled in good condition and things that we don't know things that I would not really have talked about because it was his private business,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:01,before them but I think that we would be okay with me saying thank you Wade for financing Real Estate Investors,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:08,including African Americans that happen to be investing in New Orleans East it made a difference people who own houses,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:02:44,council today I want to make myself very clear as I was able to see the last hearing that took place on January 4th,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:02:51,2023 where my clients were accused of not being locally from New Orleans and also the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:02:57,condition of the property that we are here for today I would like to start off by saying that my clients purchased,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:02,roughly 10 properties owned by the same previous owner for my bankruptcy estate and not every single one of these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:09,properties were in awful and horrendous condition most of them were in such bad shape that you could physically fall,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:15,through the flooring due to the previous owner not maintaining these properties properly and also doing improper and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:22,incorrect Renovations without the correct City permit this led to the issues that my clients are dealing with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:28,today last but not least since all of these properties have been purchased by my clients there has been non-stop false,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:03:41,the property or not pulling the proper permits this inaccurate information has led to Major hardships in my clients,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:47,completing their projects due to constant harassment from the safety and permits and the hdlc on all of these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:09:28,where that comes along with the territory but um the the the condition of the house or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:09:35,the property or any property when there is no owner or is under different ownership it's not htlc's jurisdiction,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:09:41,it's not until work begins that it falls under hdlc's short section so I just I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:10:01,and I saw the property that y'all are talking about here when it was purchased and it was in horrific condition and so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:10:09,it's a little bit surprising to see it getting restored back to what it was and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:10:14,beautiful absolutely beautiful property and then they're being fined,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:10:26,other than what you've heard but what I want to reiterate is what judge had said,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:10:31,is that look at all of the information I think it it seems that you were provided with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:10:38,a little maybe 20 percent of what the information is and to really look at all the information these properties are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:10:44,being restored they're beautiful we have landlords here that are doing the right thing they're cleaning up,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:11:30,of Saint Andrew just recently fell down it was a historic house from the 1857s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:11:36,and been a crack house for seven years and every time I try to get it fixed I said nothing to be done because it's historic house and now it's completely,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:11:42,falling down it's gone and that's it you know house is gone on the 2300 block of terpsichord a house,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:11:49,actually fell down hit the neighboring house the lady there was a lady who's lived here all her life and she had a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:11:55,little child and on Sunday morning six o'clock the neighboring house just fell down and hit her house boom you know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:12:00,good morning wake up uh at the corner of MLK and South Robinson where four houses one of which,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:12:06,had a really nice mirror of a French horn on it they're all gone brand new houses a lot of people were doing a lot,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:12:12,of work on houses that either a cannot be worked on or B the people doing the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:12:17,work are not experienced so we have driver's licenses right we don't let everybody with a driver's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:12:23,license drive an 18-wheeler we just don't do it it's a little bit different you gotta go get a class 1a whatever it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:12:29,is I would suggest the city moving forward needs to differentiate his contract licenses if you're going to take on a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:12:35,house that's a serious ass problem you need a little bit better more experience and a little better Road Track than maybe just driving a sedan down the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:12:42,street so when we're finding an owner we really should be finding the owner because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:12:48,they're the owner captain of the ship but we should also be finding the contractor because the contractor is the licensed professional experienced person,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:12:55,who is giving advice to the owner 30 seconds and so I think that while I'm in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:13:00,support of this fine uh the city has a way to go forward making things a little,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:13:05,more fair and a little more realistic because some people buy houses that cannot be saved other people buy houses,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:13:12,that can only be saved by very experienced people who are willing to spend a lot of money,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:13:17,thank you sir all right Ron you'd be the last speaker on this topic before we get the council coming,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:13:26,foreign,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:13:31,with regard to the facade only I was hired on or about 12-3 which was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:13:36,approximately four days after the hdlc stop work order was uh was put up and I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:13:43,can tell you through uh through my investigation of the existing conditions the uh the structure itself was severe,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:13:49,severely deteriorated and I would probably classify that as imminently hazardous which is a uh in this business,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:13:57,in the architectural terms it's a a very urgent manner that would be of consequence to the public if it's not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:04,immediately remediated um on information and belief the uh as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:09,the contractors were working on it the structure was literally crumbling below them and based on my observations that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:15,would appear to be correct um a large issue with the existing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:21,structure that was deteriorated was the uh non-conforming non-compliant work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:26,that was done to both the uh the second floor and a portion of the ground floor by the previous presumably the previous,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:33,owner which uh likewise I believe was also non-permitted and um done with um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:41,shoddy construction and really substandard construction methods um it was uh riddled with termite damage,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:48,and uh obvious water intrusion um leading to the the Decay that we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:54,speaking about so um I think the situation was really more of a a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:59,an act of urgency to protect the public they did reach out to the building,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:05,department 30 seconds and um continued to act to uh to stabilize the structure just as a matter of safety,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:12,which um if asked I would have recommended and they did continue to follow up with the city as far as I know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:18,thanks thank you sir um I I think we have one online comment thank you madam Clark for letting me,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:23,then cook he says I'm opposed to lowering the fine for improper demolition of a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:30,historic building the character of the building itself and the streetscape have been ruined by this unnecessary work if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:36,developers are not held accountable the character of New Orleans will be diminished thank you councilmember Thomas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:43,no this is uh interested in uh comment that one of the uh people who spoke made,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:50,I don't know if if you cleared it up or not but when in in in noticing first of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:56,all in representing uh an historic district at one point and then now overruling hdlc on a property that uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:03,went out to the location and when I put my hand on the wall uh it went through it and it was actually if we had not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:11,overruled hclc was going to probably fall and damage the house that had just been uh repaired it was the lines of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:18,responsibility because what I've noticed is that as long as an historic property sits,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:24,vacant or neglected no one says anything uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:30,but the moment someone wants to invest in a property uh to stabilize it to uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:37,to rebuild or to renovate then these agencies get involved,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:42,uh I think you said that it's because it goes from safety and permits to hdlc but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:51,but if that's the case then my question is does hdlc has an inventory of historic properties with the with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:59,rating of each of those properties in terms of uh their condition how severe,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:17:05,their condition is and then do they have a relationship with uh code enforcement,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:17:10,or safety and permits about how immediate some type of action should happen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:17:17,yes we don't have a list per se but when we find a problematic properties that are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:17:24,showing signs of demolition by neglect that would probably uh be um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:17:31,remedied through a stricter code enforcement processes we forward those properties along we have a long history,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:17:37,of doing so so then my question is so why does this seem to be more engagement when when,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:17:44,somebody someone wants to do something with it then when it's a nuisance a crack house a blight or imminent danger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:17:52,um and I'm not trying to be a physician maybe no I I understand the question and what I would say is you know we cite,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:17:58,buildings within the historic districts where we have full control for demolition by neglect and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:18:03,um perhaps because it doesn't come to hearings before you necessarily because they're blight and that doesn't come to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:18:09,the Council on appeal we're working very actively behind the scenes to try to get,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:18:14,these properties remediated um however uh if active owners,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:18:22,developers contractors are working on a property and do not obtain the proper,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:18:28,permits for the work that they are performing as in accordance with the law then that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:18:34,does trigger a response from the Regulatory Agencies including hdlc and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:18:40,safety and permits so if um a developer of course we are varying,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:18:47,um want this property to be rehabilitated we're not trying to impede that at all but we need developers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:18:53,Architects owners to get the required permits so that everybody understands,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:18:59,what work is being performed on the building and that it's all been approved and the place is our question would be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:19:06,the same rules apply to a property that's bad kind of bad real bad,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:19:15,are about to be bad for the city or do you guys apply the same rules if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:19:23,you've deemed it in store property do you apply the same rules in every category,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:19:29,um we work with um Property Owners of buildings in all states of condition and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:19:35,I ultimately our goal along with probably the owner is to get it rehabilitated so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:19:41,we're very flexible and work day in and day out with individual owners to make sure they have the permits they need,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:19:48,that they're doing work according to the law and that that work meets the guidelines and is permitted by the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:19:53,respective agencies yeah that wasn't my question my question is do you apply the same rules and policy for a property at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:20:01,each stage that I'm that I mentioned um there is you look at it the same,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:20:07,um as a historic property uh I mean it's hard to answer that question because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:20:14,it's on a case-by-case basis but we have design guidelines but on a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:20:19,case-by-case basis do the same historic and desired guidelines apply yes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:20:27,but that's your problem,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:20:37,structure it needed to be rehabilitated okay and the property owners needed to obtain the proper permits to do the work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:20:44,that they were undertaking no I'm just I'm just trying to understand it yeah and I think to a degree two things one,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:20:50,you'll hear in my comments but the other one um or Shadows what's coming up it's also part of the reason I want to consolidate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:20:57,code enforcement into one Department the fact that it lives three different places I think is exactly what you're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:21:03,saying it's a problem about who has ownership in terms of Code Enforcement number one and then number two how it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:21:10,really operates as a practical matter so I think you're right all right so um uh let me say this um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:21:18,um I I this is the first time I've seen hdlc report that has stopped work order timeline in it and I understand one,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:21:26,violation of a stop work order unintentionally through ignorance unintentionally but uh the notice of two,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:21:34,to me and going beyond the scope of the hdlc allowance is a different story with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:21:41,that said I also think councilmember Thomas and Mr bagnaris made um compelling points about how fines,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:21:50,should be applied and at this moment hdlc is still working on how to make,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:21:56,things um in tears rather than trying to decide on a case-by-case basis and I worry that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:22:04,a fine of 21 000 and some change would be arbitrary and capricious so I am lowering it uh to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:22:11,fifteen thousand dollars by my motion I would also just note that none of the neighbors have asked for a lower fine,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:22:18,below 15 000 back some of them are not happy about any reduction whatsoever so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:22:23,I appreciate also the work of everybody in this I moved to Grant the appeal and reduce the fines fifteen thousand,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:22:29,dollars seconded by council member Harris,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:39:53,um this spot is going to be for our offices uh we're a small business real estate company,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:39:59,um we're not using this to do a quick Flip or a quick turnaround um everyone in this process did exactly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:05,what they were supposed to do um nobody cut corners or did anything the contractor simply made a mistake but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:11,he thought he was doing the right thing because there was Integrity to the building um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:16,we uh we we followed closely with the hdlc to get the plans in order it was a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:23,lengthy process um the the stuff that was demolished it only went 13 beyond the scope,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:30,um it was nothing of historical significance it was vinyl siding and Termite ridden wood,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:36,um it was a mistake and and we own up to that um but everybody we self-reported this uh we didn't continue building or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:42,anything like that everybody handled this the way that it was supposed to be handled um except for the mistake of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:47,going beyond the scope of work a little bit um the way that the fine was levied I believe was unfair they based the fine,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:54,on the amount of the building that was taken off really only 13 extra was taking off we had already had the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:41:00,approval for the 50 so if there is going to be a fine levied it should be for the 13 that went beyond the scope,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:41:07,um which would be about 3 250 um we apologize,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:41:12,um Everybody did what they were supposed to do in this case except for a brief you know a brief mishap but at the end,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:41:18,of the day the contractor thought he was doing what he was supposed to do I appreciate your time and thank you for hearing my,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:41:25,thank you Michael Burnside,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:41:35,again I find myself as friends it's weird um but the bottom line is that um I'm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:41:41,not going to repeat what I said at the last discussion we had about buildings and how they end up being demoed rather,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:41:47,than replaced or repaired uh years and years and years ago uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:41:53,somebody at safety and permits was kind of to give me a little hour-long talk about their condition at that time they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:41:59,had like 10 000 demo print pits that had been permitted and yet the buildings had not been demoed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:42:05,so that seemed like an insane number to me because I hadn't been in the city for very long now it doesn't seem so insane,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:42:11,uh I think there's a lot of buildings out there that um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:42:16,are going to keep coming at you like this every time you have a city council meeting you're going to have a couple of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:42:21,these just sitting on your plate and uh I don't know if that's really the best way to handle them,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:42:28,one idea of course is to require some fines directly to the contractor the contractor is licensed right if your,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:42:36,truck drivers breaking a speed limit and he gets busted by the cops for speeding generally it's not the owner of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:42:41,truck that gets busted it's the truck driver that's why he has a license that's what makes him sort of responsible and vulnerable to being,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:42:48,punished so we don't necessarily need the owner to try to extract money out of a contractor who may decide to declare,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:42:54,bankruptcy and just leave town uh the other thing is that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:00,jail time needs to be considered right so there's a difference between civil penalties and criminal penalties and the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:05,intent is key to this if you really believe that this is a malicious actor then you should be able to send them to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:11,jail for five days or three days or two days fingerprint them see if they're wanted for some kind of warrants in Minnesota or something,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:17,if you believe that there was an actual accident and they self-reported and you're really sad and it's really uh you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:23,know deeply regretted and whatever then you just treat it like the Civil matter and you know hit them for whatever you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:28,feel is appropriate but uh requiring owners to punish their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:34,contractors seems to be a model that has not worked in this city and the idea of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:39,not including any criminal component I think allows the Bad actors to hide among the mediocre actors to hide among,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:47,the innocent actors thank you uh Mr Burnside so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:53,um you know Zach thank you for being so forthcoming uh thank you for being forthcoming as well I think that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:44:05,things like this um go unlooked um the hdlc determined a 63 of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:44:24,um to ten thousand dollars and I think that's a fair assessment so I'm knocking off uh about five thousand nine hundred,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:44:30,and eighty dollars of what the hdlc determined and you'll have to pay a ten thousand dollar fine,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:53:08,um that though you have a right to own a firearm no one has a right to own it irresponsibly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:53:14,and that happens too many instances in which people have arms um guns especially,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNPq_Gv5-E&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
