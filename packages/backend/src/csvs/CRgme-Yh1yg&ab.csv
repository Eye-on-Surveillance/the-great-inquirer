30:03:00,and exposure so when they hear it coming from you as legislators talking about Firearms,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:10:00,they think you're coming from a place of experience and it's not always the case I mean I know I know I've grown up a lot,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

30:39:00,that's why that's why you have the grandmother with the gun under the pillow and the kid gets shot or the kid have access to me we just don't know we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:46:00,have to admit that we don't know and say exclude us,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

31:57:00,this that when it comes to women getting any training is it's just not happening and I can tell you that women appear to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
32:04:00,be buying more firearms because of what's Happening you know with violent crime in the city,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
32:10:00,um yet they're not getting getting the training and so whatever we can do to also kind of you know hone in on making,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
32:17:00,sure that that women are receiving this training I think it's key because I think often um you know maybe with with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
32:23:00,men you may have a father-son type of situation the father teaches the son about the responsible gun ownership that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
32:30:00,type of thing but it's I think it's more rare for a father to teach the daughter but then they grow up they get a firearm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
32:36:00,because they're scared of whatever may be happening and they don't have the proper training which makes me pivot,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

36:24:00,been on top of the fact that our DB office is kind of failing and really not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
36:29:00,making an effort to make sure that disadvantaged business ideas and by that in particular African-American owned disadvantagedies,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

37:16:00,for someone this is really basic to have an affidavit requirement from a contractor saying I went to the DB list,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:24:00,I contacted all the firms that were eligible and none of them were,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:29:00,interested and then say after I've completed and good faith effort with an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:35:00,affidavit with the receipts that no one was able to participate then look at a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:40:00,waiver but right now the way these waivers are being put out there it's like the moment that a contract's let,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:47:00,there's a waiver falling right behind it and from the city's position if we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:53:00,preemptively waiving DB participation we cannot look at our community with a straight,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:00:00,face and say that contractors aren't trying if we aren't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:05:00,even requiring them to pretend like they're trying to do that work so I think it's something that the council is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:11:00,going to have to take up and address I think we're gonna have to look at what the dbe policy is as far as procurement because what is the point of having a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:18:00,qualified list and being a qualified DB provider is not easy going through that entire process being put on that list,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:24:00,with the expectation that you'll get opportunities and then the city continually waiving the requirement to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:30:00,do so it's it's worse than lying to someone it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:37:00,making them go through a tremendous amount of effort when you have no intention of actually following through so that's something the council's going,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:43:00,to work on absolutely if I could respond to that so Johnson um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:49:00,you know you're bringing up a very vital point in our research,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:55:00,we looked at the memorial administration because they did so much,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:00:00,to eliminate and reduce crime and murder in New,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:05:00,Orleans and something that is so outstanding in what happened,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:11:00,was the fact that the mayor worked in tandem with city council and got the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:19:00,legislation necessary to put things in motion to get them done,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:24:00,and once they did that they would come back to make sure,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:30:00,that things were being attended to properly and I think while council is considering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:38:00,a lot of things they need to consider the enforcement piece as well,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:44:00,because without enforcement we're we're nowhere we're I mean we're where we started,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:50:00,thank you and also I'm sorry uh we would like to think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:58:00,you present council members uh and uh council person Moreno we we saw the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:05:00,report card that the collaborative came before you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:11:00,and got past look we thank you very much for that because that is an ordinance,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:18:00,that's already on the books that has not been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:23:00,are followed in that office of Supplier Diversity you guys have to take a look,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:30:00,at what they're doing whether they need more people or what and you also have to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:37:00,look at these dbes who are being used by the primes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:46:00,they're not doing the work they're being used by the prime and that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:51:00,does not help our black businesses what you call it the pass-throughs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:58:00,they have to be that's an interesting point Mr Vargas I will tell you that's something in my brief time when I was in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:05:00,the private sector between being a senator being a council member and I would try to work with trying to place,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:10:00,DBS in a variety of different situations you would have qualified dbes who would,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:15:00,respond to an offer to be a DB partner and they say listen we just want your name on this contract it says you're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:23:00,going to get four positions I'm gonna give you one and we'll get the three in-house I'm just gonna pay you some money on the side but the whole point of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:30:00,a DB program which is why you grow out of them is that you take a disadvantaged business,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:36:00,you help them find opportunity and that at some point they'd be able to compete,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:42:00,with the primes and grow to a point where they're successful business on their own and the problem you have is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:49:00,when you don't check the receipts you don't make sure that the DBS that are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:54:00,being involved are able and willing to do the work is that you allow a perpetuation of a model where the DBS,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:02:00,are just pastors to your point where you have certainty being when you see the same D pop up on 20 different projects,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:08:00,and that program they're doing the same work for 20 years they've never become a prime that itself should kind of be a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:15:00,red flag if you've been doing this same kind of work you're an expert in that field and you're never a prime,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:21:00,somebody's gonna check the receipts and go hey if you guys have been a partner and you have this much experience why,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:29:00,hasn't your company grown because you're supposed to eventually graduate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:35:00,from the program so that other DBS behind you could take advantage you shouldn't be parked on the list as a DB,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:42:00,pass through taking up space where new DBS don't have the opportunity to grow,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:47:00,and compete so I hear you on that I know councilman Moreno has worked with the collaborative previously on that and I'd,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:52:00,love to work with you all as well to figure out how we can look into the office and how we could reform that because to your point during Memorial,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:00:00,Administration you saw a tremendous amount of growth in the black middle class right and since the memorial,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:06:00,Administration you have seen no growth if not a reversal of the black middle,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:12:00,class and a lot of that is because there were advantages in Contracting as a DB to grow and create a company and once,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:19:00,you took your foot off the gas and started pumping the brake everything stopped so I look forward to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

44:08:00,to look at former net you know add net to the policies yeah I mean one of the interesting things in this community even from our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:15:00,media uh they'll investigate political corruption they'll investigate crime but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:20:00,when you talk about economic corruption and disparity you don't see the special on that you don't see the special on our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:28:00,community not getting the money it deserves I mean there are never politician they'll NAB an agency here,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:34:00,but very rarely where you see our immediate media dedicate uh much of their investigations and much of their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:40:00,time to the economic disparities so you know you know so maybe that'll happen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:46:00,one day councilmember green I appreciate you all being here today with your presentation and um I look forward to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:52:00,working with you more um no brag just fact I was ahead of Small Business Development on Memorial,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:58:00,and was the head of Economic Development under Memorial and we did deliberately work to build a stronger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:05:00,African-American middle class but one of the things that we did Wiley was sometimes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:12:00,if the requirements weren't met if we just wouldn't do that work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:17:00,and then the message gets out that at the end of the day you need to find a disadvantaged business Enterprise to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:24:00,partner with to get that work done I've only been here you know in this position a year and that was 25 years,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:30:00,ago that I was the head of economic development but um as we have that discussion one of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:37:00,one of the things that you can hold over the Contracting Community is that it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:43:00,not so important that we get it done if we don't get it done with participation by minority and women-owned businesses,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:50:00,and that is something that sometimes isn't necessarily within the purview of the council but something that we can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:57:00,continue to emphasize and maybe as we go forward we recognize that maybe that particular job is so symbolically,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:04:00,important that until you come back with the DDE who's going to participate it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:09:00,just won't get done just food for thought as to how we could potentially move forward on having the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:15:00,participation's levels increased because I think that there's always a sense too,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:21:00,often that there's urgency in getting it done and the city's going to get it done no matter how we're going to Wade the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:26:00,dbe requirement we're going to waive the other requirements because we have to get it done maybe we don't have to get,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

59:26:00,other thing is that there's been a lot of work Mr Parker done behind the scenes not publicly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:31:00,but that's that's some of the research that my my staff and some of the folk in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

59:55:00,on the surface but not dbes in terms of who they hire and who they do business with there are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:02,few they're few what dbes are African-American,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:09,and which ones of white female,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:14,that's right that qualify as dbe there has to be a more intense study,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:22,than just talking about it and saying we're going to take a look at it no we're going to put a microscope,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:28,on it we're going to look at all those companies that have benefited over the last several decades and hopefully when,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:36,that study that work is done we can take a look at who's taking advantage of the system,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:41,who's benefited from from the system because there are some dbe companies,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:46,that if you go to their office they don't have any dbes working for them yes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:52,yes you're not having any African-American young men and women that even then pull away,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:57,and they'll complain about getting contracts but when you think their subs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:02,aren't women or minority contractors but they'll come and complain about getting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:08,contract I think it's time that we put the microscope to that and I think what you guys clam plan did Mr Johnson would,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:16,say that we're not going to be safe unless every element of this city is a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:21,reflection of justice and a reflection of fairness and what I'm going to do with this committee now and hopefully my,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:28,colleagues will agree we have focused on crime and criminal justice and all the components of the criminal justice,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:33,agency but I think it's equally important if we're going to deal with crime that Supply diversity come here and talk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:39,about the role that they're playing in crime reduction that housing come here and talk about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:09:31,work into three different areas one prevention apprehension wraparound services for victims,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:37,I want to take a moment to just provide the public an update on the public available,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:42,um stats provided by the New Orleans Police Department um last Wednesday they actually released updated,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:48,um numbers an hour ago before this presentation I'm in no way saying that we are out of this violent crime crisis,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:54,no whatsoever we still have a lot of work to do but do you think it's important to share the information with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:59,the public as we go through um the work the nlpdo collectively is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:05,reporting a 20 reduction in persons crime and I've listed the individual areas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:11,um on the slide the information is released weekly by the superintendent's office to the nlpd,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:16,um and again the department just released this latest update about an hour ago um but the the stats provided today go,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:23,through March 25th of this year,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:28,first our first order of business was to prevent acts of violent crime and we wanted to do that by making the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:34,environmental conditions as pleasant as possible so there has been a creative,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:39,and and incredible effort um to remove contributors to violence,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:45,one being blighted property um repairing street lights and the removal of junk and abandoned vehicles,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:51,or hazardous vehicles um at our very first task force meeting the nlpd advised that there was a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:57,connection with violent crime with abandoned and drunk us drunk Vehicles being used to store drugs and weapons,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:03,and so coordinating with the Department of Public Works and we worked really hard to remove as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:09,many of these vehicles as possible in areas that were hit by violent crime as we all know uh the fleet of DPW was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:17,challenged at the beginning of this onset um at the time they had six tow trucks available which I think got down,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:22,to two um we were able to look at existing ordinances on the books and muster up,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:28,some additional reinforcement from private tow companies to remove as many vehicles off the street as possible and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:33,as of this morning that number has gone to 254 Vehicles removed off our streets that the Department of Public Works have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:39,determined to be junk or hazardous um regarding uh blight,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:45,we know that blighted properties amongst our city light is an issue for us the council has made it very clear that is a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:53,priority of of the council but also the administration to get the dirt out of people's eyes and we when quality of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:00,life increases crime goes down um particularly when you look at the crime stats uh in the overlay reports of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:07,blight um they they go hand in hand and so working with individual councilmatic districts and offices and also working,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:13,with the individual police captains of the districts addresses that are known to be issues,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:19,were elevated to the task force to evaluate for abatement sometimes the abatement is demolition sometimes the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:25,abatement is fencing um but the the confounds of the the ordinances and laws are in place,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:32,um 80 20 Olive Street was a car wash that was used in District B in the commission of a homicide in January also,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:39,we had information to believe that the property was being used for illegal drug use um his storage of stolen via I'm stolen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:45,I'm property we did an inspection and the Department of Code Enforcement did their normal process and determined that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:51,this property was indeed an imminent threat to Public Safety and ordered the emergency demolition the property owner,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:57,has since filed an emergency order for that demolition to pause and the order,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:03,was signed by a judge it's my understanding that the settlement has been reached between the city and the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:09,property owner and how to bring this property back one into Commerce but also remedy the public safety risks so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:15,although the property the demolition did not continue the ultimate goal of bringing the property to safe condition,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:21,I do believe occurred with the fencing and the removing of the the barriers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:26,made it easy to commit criminal activity on this property the settlement I believe is going through the digital process now,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:33,I mean there's some uh responsibility on the part of the property owner that if they do not do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:38,this then the city will continue with this demolition but the office of Code Enforcement is is handling that case um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:44,but I know we did a press Avail there to talk about the demolition excuse me council member Moreno thank you thank,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:52,you um my question is why not uh initially go in and and you know work with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:00,owner saying we will you know tear down your property,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:05,or take a very aggressive steps on your property if if you don't come up with corrective actions instead of you know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:13,if if they wouldn't have stopped it the business would have been torn down and and I mean it seems like,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:19,finding ways to work with business or Property Owners is probably the the the best approach why didn't that happen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:26,instead of just moving forward with just demolition absolutely so the Department of Code Enforcement has many abatement,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:32,tools right and I will say this property owner has known about this condition for a while the city did provide a notice,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:40,um about what the intent was and it wasn't until we arrived at the property of the owner appeared and said hey I'm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:45,willing to have a conversation um so there was an opportunity to engage or an attempt to engage the property owner the owner is known to the City of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:52,New Orleans but I will say in later on in the presentation there's an example of that happening which you just said,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:57,where we actually had an on-site visit with a property owner we collectively came to a agreement and and that has,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:03,happened but in this case um it was elevated and we asked for recommendations of what was the what was the way what was the appropriate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:09,abatement to remedy the public safety risk and through the inspections and assessments it was recommended demolition was the the appropriate order,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:15,that isn't always the case sometimes it is a meeting or a fence when this case demolition was what I was determined to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:21,be the most appropriate thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:28,as we know um technology is used as a force multiplier for all of us that work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:34,in in public safety we using um the with the admin introduction of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:41,Home cameras and many different surveillance uh that people have have employed so you protect their own,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:46,property we did identify a resource to get that information to the nopd much,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:52,faster we launched the or announced that we had joined the neighbors by ring,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:57,program which pretty much anyone in the City of New Orleans can download the neighbors app if you have video footage,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:03,from any of your systems not just ring but it could be any of the system providers that provide home surveillance the police department could engage with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:10,the resident and information can be provided electronically through the app as opposed to a burdensome process of a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:16,police officer having to knock on the door and canvas the neighborhood we did hear from some residents they were reluctant to provide information because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:23,they don't want their neighbors to see the police knock on their door but now this is a way where they can provide information or intelligence to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:28,enforcement after a crime has been committed in their neighborhood without fear of people knowing that they've had,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:34,that particular type of Engagement so again the city did join neighbors by ring the nlpd detective units and and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:42,District Personnel attended a training on how to use this platform,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:49,next um to councilman Moreno's point I wanted to talk about how some business,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:56,owners have decided to commercialize violence at the request of the mayor she asked us,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:03,to pay a visit to this merchandise Store where the property owner was selling merchandise that incited,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:11,violence I have some pictures of the of the merchandise up on the screen but I also have some here where this was being,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:17,sold to our children in our gas stations and it talks about breaking hearts,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:22,there's weapons there's machine guns they were selling ski masks so we paid,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:28,um a visit to the store and I will say the property owner voluntarily removed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:33,all the merchandise from all the stores Citywide because they did not want to contribute to the commercialization of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:38,violence so Council Moreno to your point speaking with the business owner this is a huge win we also I will say from an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:45,ordinance perspective we did find in the city Charter where there is a Prohibition on certain type of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:50,merchandise contributing to the delinquency of a minor I think that ordinance may need to be expanded to include merchandises that inside,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:56,violence there's a fine Free Speech issue there right and so I mean it requires some exploration,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:03,um but we wanted to take this off the approach first to say hey this really is a helping us and the property owner complied but at the same time that same,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:09,conversation we were able to talk about getting surveillance cameras connected to the real-time crime Center and do a holistic wrap around how can this one,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:16,particular Corner Store really helped us all be safe and and and and and in that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:21,same vein just a reminder that the council unanimously passed the padlock ordinance as well which can also be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:28,another useful tool when you are seeing criminal activity uh at businesses I'm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:33,not saying that that was occurring in this particular business but um if it is uh the chief has that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:39,discretion to move forward with the with the parts of the padlock ordinance to work with the with the property owner to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:46,remedy that situation I've also had conversations with the District Attorney's Office it also wants to work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:51,closely with the chief on the legal parameters around that so that it isn't such a tremendous burden on just our Law,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:57,Department to do all those review processes so just another Tool uh in in the tool chest there thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:05,next we are also emphasizing our existing programs the city spent a lot of uh time and energy and creating the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:11,real-time crime Center a large investment I mean there's an opportunity there to for residents to enrich the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:17,intelligence footprint or or access to information to the crime Center so I'll give you an example we have looking at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:24,the data we have some apartment complexes one in particular that has had 256 911 calls since January 1.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:32,um and so uh myself and some of the task force members will be paying a visit to many of these properties and meeting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:37,with property owners to talk about conditions in the complex um talk about surveillance cameras and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:42,can we get them connected to the real-time crime Center even as far as looking at their parking regulations on property do you allow only visitors to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:50,park what happens when a vehicle is here that doesn't belong here who do you call um so we're really looking to expand and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:56,those existing programs and connecting um video cameras on private properties to the real-time crime Center and areas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:02,that we know um have spike in crime I think we've all seen an increase in violence and social media so as right,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:10,now while I'm here meta the company that owns Facebook and many other social media platforms is here in New Orleans,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:20:35,um I will say um since the task force has been stood up I'm now getting all kinds of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:40,social media posts that people see they're reporting but now we have a place to get that information and get the information to law enforcement for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:47,action and investigation and it's not just the New Orleans Police Department taking part in this training,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:53,today it's all of our law enforcement Partners from State Police and our regional law enforcement Partners as well,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:00,particularly um around legislative needs and recommendations just a couple things that have happened,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:06,um House Bill 396 sponsored by representative Delicia Boyd has been filed for this regular session and what,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:13,this does it closes a major loophole in protection orders and our evaluation of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:20,domestic violence in Louisiana when a judge issues a protection order that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:25,protection order has to be sent to Baton Rouge for entering into a National Database the staff entering those protection,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:31,orders does not work at the hours or on weekends so sometime just three or four days before law enforcement even knows,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:37,that an order has been issued and we've had instances where individuals will call 9-1-1 to report the person who's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:42,ordered to stay away has returned because it's not in the system the law enforcement hands are limited and so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:49,this ordinance or this change in state law requires entry into the registry within two hours of a judge issuing the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:55,protection order I have a a quick comment um and question on this so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:01,I'm familiar with it thank you Mr chair I'm sorry to have just jumped in there thank you Mr chair,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:07,um so you actually have two legislators up here uh who worked on comprehensive,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:15,domestic violence legislation back in in 2014 where this this originally,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:22,um was put together I was the lead author and and at the time Senator morale was my co-author uh who,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:28,shepherded it through the Senate where it was it got very complicated so what you're doing in this particular,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:34,legislation is you are um you're reducing the really the time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:39,length and reading the legislation from the uh the orders being entered uh by,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:47,the end of the next business day and limiting that to within two hours now I think that that is I think that's that's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:55,good I think that's key and I can tell you that back when Senator Morrell and I were in the legislature we wanted the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:00,same no doubt about it we we absolutely uh wanted uh the same we wanted we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:06,wanted it done immediately two hours was was too late even uh The Advocates said we wanted it um immediately,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:15,I wish you would have had discussions with with myself or or council member morale about this legislation because we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:22,could have explained to you some of the the issues that we had uh with this and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:27,one um is we received great opposition by the clerks Association and uh they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:35,explained to us all of the different um technological issues that they were,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:41,facing and and how it was going to be to the point of it of impossible of getting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:46,it done immediately within within seconds that would have been that would have you know would have been our our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:54,our goal unfortunately we couldn't get that done so look if you if you can get,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:00,this done I think that would be great if we can shorten the time period it could be great but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:06,um you know I think that there are while this is important and this is key,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:11,um I think that there are other bigger issues dealing with um domestic violence in our city that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:18,that are even much more pressing including uh something that we can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:24,locally control here dealing with the transfer of firearms and that's something again that myself and and at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:31,the time Senator Morrell uh worked on that is still happening and you can talk to the health department at a very,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:37,limited manner um we have very few firearms that are actually being relinquished by these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:44,offenders that's what's getting people killed that's what's absolutely getting people killed is is these offenders,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:51,still holding on to those Firearms as you know victims of domestic violence are five times more more likely to be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:57,murdered if there is a firearm in the home and so I think that like if we want,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:03,to talk about like real big efforts that this task force could do on DV it's on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:09,how do we expedite and really make these firearm transfers work I get it that we're one of the only parishes that's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:15,really like initiating this and moving forward with us which I think is great but you know getting 20 firearms from,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:21,people annually is like not nearly enough of what we should be getting so I think to continue to press on that I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:28,think would be um Keith and I'm sorry uh council member morale to have jumped in front of you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:35,in front of him that's that's all right ladies ladies,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:41,I think my assessment's a bit more blunt,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:46,this was really this bill what I saw it up there and I re-looked,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:53,at it and councilman right now and I were talking about our experience getting us both of the process this is the exact reason why months ago,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:01,when this task force was created we said the way it was created and the rationale,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:08,behind the way it was created and the exclusion of the council this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:13,this just the way this legislation was filed was really Bush League,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:19,I walked out of here a moment ago and called the head of the clerk Association and I said hey are you familiar with House Bill 370 he's actually said yeah,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:26,I'm we're completely opposed to it we negotiated with y'all last time we explained to y'all the challenges of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:34,this bill because we always look in this city we look at our problems through the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:39,lens of our court system there are many parishes in this state,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:44,where you'll have one Court over multiple parishes the reason why 48 hours which was a fight to get sorry was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:52,it 24 hours before I was 24 hours right the reason why we had to fight to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:58,get that is because every court system in the entire state is dramatically,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:03,different they have technological limitations they have physical limitations and the like what I want to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:09,point in the existing legislation and why I really think that legislation is not necessary is it says no later than,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:17,the end of the next business day there's no reason why we could not go over to civil district court and tell the judges,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:23,we want you to do these things in 30 minutes because they could right now the language of the law is no later than,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:31,24 hours when you go to the state level to change the law for the entire State,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:38,you're going to have to negotiate with 63 other parishes to see how what you're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:44,going to do influences 63 other parishes and honestly before I file any,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:50,legislation or filed any legislation that affected A specific group the first thing I did was look at who are the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:57,affected parties is going to be in opposition meet with those people identify the challenges and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:04,try to work around it I will tell you in my experience as a legislator when you file a bill without,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:10,doing that first you're basically wasting your time it's a tremendous waste of time it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:16,performative and the thing you're going to get up there is they're going to say it says no later than 24 hours the next,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:23,day why can't you ask your courts to do it sooner because they can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:31,also in your response,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:37,so response I will be very clear this is not an issue that was uh presented or or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:44,that the task force picked up in January the mayor has a domestic violence working group that needs regularly has,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:51,since I've been here for the past six years the judges collectively that are represented identified this as a barrier,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:58,and when we when we spoke with the Louisiana protection order registry it was their recommendation that said you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:04,need to change the state law to speed up this process so there's no way did I say or this task force say this needs to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:10,happen but also I think it's also important to understand how this process works right now the law precludes a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:16,court a clerk themselves from entering into the registry the law says they must send it to Baton Rouge and that is the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:22,only entity that can enter into the registry so the legislation opens that Authority up for other agencies that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:29,have the training the technology tools available to enter into the registry directly also for the protection order,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:35,of registry is not unique to Louisiana it's an FBI file in the National Center crime information center there are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:41,standards that are available so if you want to have quick access and enter into the system right now the law precludes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:46,us from using those other systems because it says we must use the Louisiana protection registry in Baton,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:51,Rouge and so the law although will be well intended it has heightened restrained so much that the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:57,individual courts can't make those independent actions two things first,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:02,the reason why we created like I said history the legislative,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:08,legislature create the protective order registry was so that individuals as they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:13,moved between parishes if I'm correct uh Council vice president if you got a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:19,protected order in Orleans and you went to Jefferson and they called they could,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:25,check to see you have an order in Orleans so the whole reason why we had it was for individuals as they move,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:31,about the state that the order could follow them it does down effect correct,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:36,however there is nothing that precludes us locally if you get a protective order,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:43,in Orleans Parish to have that order as quickly as possible and to have nopd,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:50,notify that a protective order is in place there's nothing that precludes that but it also assumes you stay in the parish but when you have the people who,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:57,was the most we have plenty of problems on the Parish of Orleans and my understanding with this task force was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:03,we're solving the problems of New Orleans I appreciate because I'm sorry people don't keep calling,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:09,representative Moreno I appreciate because Council vice president I spent over a decade you spent about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:16,half a decade up in Baton Rouge solving the state's problems we have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:21,significant problems in our Parish now what I will tell you is when I hear,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:27,judges complain about they need the state law change it reminds me of my arguments I've had regarding the mobile,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:32,reform a judge does not need the council to do bail reform to set appropriate bails I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:39,don't know back there you can listen way on this too but if a judge wants to settle a little bill for somebody,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:44,because they're on a risk they can do that they don't need us to tell them that if a judge wants to expedite,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:50,protective orders if the judge wants to work with nopd to notify them printables,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:55,Assad if we collectively want to have a local database we can do that we don't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:00,need a legislative fix and don't appreciate this was the recommendation of the DB task force and other state,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:07,actors if it's their recommendation why is it on your presentation because domestic,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:13,violence is a contributor violent crime this is one area,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:19,recommendation to start over State problem and this is the because I recall this is the New Orleans,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:26,violent task force we need to have solutions that deal with solving violent crime in New Orleans immediately yeah I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:33,appreciate tackling state issues like I said did that for over over a decade we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:40,need solutions that are going to help New Orleans now I don't think to be clear the way this bill was found I mean,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:47,even looking at the committed makeup I mean this bill's been sent to house judiciary which has some great New England members,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:54,on it it's got two fantastic legislators from New Orleans on it it's got a great,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:01,Democratic chair but also has eight Republicans so it's got four Democrats eight,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:07,Republicans on an issue that I can tell you candidly from my experience with Council vice,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:37:11,century 21st off in the 18th century to the 19th century and then what,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:18,frustrates me is that rather than work with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:23,council to figure out a local solution to address the issue because this legislative issue,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:29,like I said maybe maybe you're right maybe you're going to go up there cite your stats to the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:38:18,to sit down with the people who've done that by before and build a path to be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:38:57,technology that you say is there and and available they should have zero problem with getting that done so I think that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:39:04,that could be a win for New Orleans I I do wish you the very best of luck in the legislative session I think if you get,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:39:43,in this city and across the state is lack of enforcement of the laws that's the biggest problem and until uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:39:51,we are a city that's going to take domestic violence seriously until we have a criminal justice system that's going to take domestic violence,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:39:57,seriously we can pass all the laws all the laws that we want and it's all for not so that's what I ask you as the head,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:47:08,spike in public safety use I'm doing a site visit with the property management at these large apartment complexes to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:47:22,I'm going to a couple places this week in New Orleans East and what I'm finding is that property owners are are more,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:47:27,than willing to come to the table with resources but they need the city to meet them uh halfway as far as uh enforcement,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:47:35,but also connecting their cameras in the real-time crime Center there were some,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:47:40,barriers there around what type of cameras we're looking to explain explore the type of feeds that can come into the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:47:46,center and finally um bringing critical services to community we've heard from,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:47:52,our residents that the Emergency Services the things that stabilize families emergency food housing rental,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:47:58,assistance um if they have any transportation issue getting to City Hall to access those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:48:04,Services is difficult during covid we did deploy city services to our libraries to make it more readily,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:48:10,available and accessible to see if that model will still work bringing the services for people who we say needed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:48:16,the most to them on the ground um so we're exploring a model now to bring those City wraparound services that are uh that are designed to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:48:23,stabilize people in an emergency or a crisis to closer to the to where they are when you hear from those that have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:48:30,committed acts of violence in a lot of cases it's crimes of desperation and so we can remove the desperation the intent,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:48:36,is to remove the criminal element as well finally I think he goes about saying you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:48:43,know from the discussion today I think all of us here are committed to reducing violent crime but it's going to take all of us to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:48:50,have difficult conversations around perspective but also get to a place where we can move forward together and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:48:56,commit to a plan moving forward I will say the New Orleans Police Department,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:49:02,um is is the bread and butter of keeping our streets safe but they can't do it alone and I will say I know if they come,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:49:09,to the council um her resources I would ask from the task force perspective they are met they are augmented in their their tools and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:49:16,needs from a budgetary perspective are are provided um we as Leaders got to be bold we got,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:49:22,to be Innovative think outside the box the the the conditions on the ground that we see today are not the same,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:49:27,conditions we saw yesterday um and finally this Spike and violent crime didn't happen overnight,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:49:33,um so I hope no one thought I was coming today to say hey we've solved all the violent crime there was never going to be the reality,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:49:39,um but I will say I do think that you know I was yeah I was hoping you would come in and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:49:55,nobody gets hurt so I hear you but duh the expectation is going to be every day,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:50:02,that we're the safest city their children aren't dying that people aren't dying and women are B and families,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:50:07,aren't being abused and so you know I know you're making your comments but know that for me that's the expectation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:50:14,every day I understood sir and I appreciate that and we share that um but I had the battles and and realism,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:50:22,um that's it uh is it difficult work um and we're committed every single day and I will say,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:50:28,um the council members offices that have engaged the task force on a daily basis thank you they have been invaluable to this process giving us information,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:50:35,um as we move through this the city and finally we're all working together for a safer New Orleans and with that I can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:50:40,take any questions,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:50:50,Anita you have a slide for me and then we have several speakers in the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:50:56,audience that want to address this issue,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:51:06,okay um explain what the slide is this I understand,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:51:13,um on your slide deck I want to say it was slide number say two sides so let's say one two,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:51:20,slot number one one two three slide number three you have the year-to-date violent crime,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:51:27,numbers with this very impressive uh reduction in violent crime,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:51:35,what that is that red number is the gone on arrivals,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:51:41,I think that it's important for us to acknowledge the people of the city whenever we publish numbers saying oh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:51:49,man violent crime is down they're like well I'm still getting shot or stabbed or mugged,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:51:55,the reality is that if you follow that chart and I know my Council data nerd,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:02,over there knows the charts better than I do violent crime as we understand it has,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:09,not necessarily gone down substantially it's just that you don't have a lot of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:15,people that are willing to wait I think on average depending on what it is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:21,even the response time for violent crime is higher now than it was last year is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:28,that correct,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:35,but looking at this chart it's difficult to talk about the governor arrivals what,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:40,incidents were reported are they instances of violence or are these all collectible these are violent crimes so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:46,let's see so on average violent crimes we're also receiving okay so the average,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:51,response time to a violent crime incident in January February March 2023,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:58,was 79 67 and 106 minutes respectively up from 57 56 and 84 minutes on average,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:53:07,in those three months for violent crime for non-violent crime the response time averaged 161 minutes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:53:14,150 151 minutes in January 155 minutes in February 165 minutes of March up,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:53:21,considerably from 139 133 and 156 minutes on average for the first months,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:53:27,of 2022. whenever you throw out data,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:53:33,and you rely upon data to make representations of the public you have to present all the data,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:53:38,and we know from last year we had this huge multiple Council means on it about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:53:44,how it is important to acknowledge the fact that with our dwindling police force and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:53:52,other challenges as response times continue to climb there is a growing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:53:57,number of people that due to the situation they're in the environment they're in or a variety,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:54:05,of other pressures they're not willing to wait forever for the police to show up,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:54:11,and it's important that we acknowledge that potentially more than likely a crime occurred,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:54:17,it's just the person the victim wasn't willing to hang out and I get very as you can tell a little,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:54:24,perturbed when we continue to try and paint Rosy numbers without that acknowledgment when you look at that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:54:31,tremendous growing gap of going on animals,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:54:37,we should not mislead the public to believe that they are necessarily less,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:54:44,likely to be have an aggravated battery aggravated assault aggravated rape simple rape,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:54:51,armed robbery or simple robbery this year than last year it is more,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:54:57,likely that if one of those things happens you gotta wait longer for a police officer and depend on how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:55:03,traumatic the incident runs you might not be willing to wait that extra 15 20,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:55:08,30 45 minutes I will say however based on the analysis,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:55:14,of our Council that data uh data researcher carjackings are in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:55:21,fact down by all metrics and as far as all the rest of violent crime the gold on the problem will,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:55:27,continue to grow so and those where we respond yeah there's lots of them but there's a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:55:33,somehow that take place where by the time a police officer shows the person's not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:55:40,there and we do a very poor job a very poor job of acknowledging the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:55:45,fact that I have several reports that they were robbed and we show up 45 minutes an hour later they may not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:55:53,still be on that street corner that our robbery did take place,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:55:59,I don't want to cut you off and make sure you were done I'm waiting for your response unless I'm done yet so okay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:56:04,okay um so again looking at this chart as it is this does,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:56:11,not tell me much about the information this tells me the instances that a call was marked up Goa,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:56:16,so I can't articulate to you that what this chart means if you were to break it out by incident type and priority and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:56:23,time lapse so we can really see what was reported to 9-1-1 like a shooting in progress marked up Goa yes that's a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:56:28,that's a challenge but I don't think that's the reality but again I I look for I have always been willing to come,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:56:36,to the table to look at the data and we can all walk away the same [ __ ] in music but what I can't do is come today throw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:56:42,up a chart and you expect me to give you an answer as to why that thing is red because I could get an answer but you you gave us a slide with all these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:56:50,numbers saying negative eight percent negative 21 9 negative nine percent and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:56:56,you've presented with us with one of the supporting data that says why these numbers are this way well I think it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:57:03,until I think that's a little bit misleading right so the source of that data is at the bottom of the presentation I think you all get it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:57:08,every Wednesday when the police department puts it out if the information comes from their public facing information but that chart is on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:57:14,the council dashboard okay but again which is also data or from the New,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:57:19,Orleans Police Department right okay so but you can't if I ask you right now how many of these glas are shootings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:57:29,I think that perhaps rather than showing up with your numbers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:57:35,and linking to a website maybe Mr chairman we should get Mr Asher,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:57:42,here with a list of his numbers and we can compare what I dislike the Heavenly is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:57:49,when we try to have a political Rosy picture without the caveat that the picture,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:57:56,might not be as rosy as people think that situation which was egregious last,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:58:03,year has gotten worse is that true or false,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:58:09,communication District yes when someone reports a crime,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:58:14,do you track as to whether or not an officer showed up with an RTF or going,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:58:19,on we entered the information to the system do we analyze that data no the police department does that as the head,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:58:26,of a violent crime task force we all study the requests for the follow-ups,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:58:32,and vulnerable level and the discrepancy no we're not what we're looking at right now is that's a problem okay well what,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:58:38,we are looking at is the information presented to us by the New Orleans Police Department of confirmed crimes that have been reported and reports have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:58:45,been taken We're Not Gonna I'm not gonna allow us to sit here and say someone's been shot and and because they didn't want to wait they got up and left that's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:58:51,not the reality if someone say is involved in a shooting and they end up at a hospital hospital police will call,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:58:56,us and a report is taken it's not necessary word we we had testimony and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:59:02,anecdotal evidence last year people were actually raped we decided not to wait,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:59:07,for an hour so what you're saying is that if a rape victim doesn't run away I mean I'll give,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:59:13,you my own anecdotal uh my own anecdotal information or witnessed a drive-by shooting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:59:23,I think there are a tremendous amount of people who witness are victims of crimes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:59:29,who we don't do a good enough job doing follow-ups and because we as a city do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:59:36,not do follow-up that does not mean a crime didn't occur it means that we help,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:59:42,people to an unreasonable timeline and I think that if we're gonna take the time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:59:48,to Pat ourselves on the back about dropping numbers we we need to make sure,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:59:54,the numbers actually dropped because if officers are not able to respond,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:01,Timely a violent or non-violent crimes and because of that a crime is reported,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:07,but there is no follow-up to the person was not present because the city take the position of what that person didn't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:14,wait two hours or an hour or 45 minutes there was no crime your numbers are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:20,based upon those gone alarms never existed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:26,but the Garner arrivals are not elements in the the major categories of violent crime,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:33,the murders the shootings and the stabbing so you're saying simple rape and aggravated rape or not violent,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:39,crimes no when I talk about the immediate threat to Life Safety right when someone may be shot and also be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:44,murdered right we cannot paint this picture as if the police department or or myself or anyone is trying to paint a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:51,picture we are presenting information compared to Prior year I'm not telling you what the information on here is not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:56,accurate what I'm asking for is an opportunity to get a little more detail so I can speak a little bit more questions not to believe the point miss,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:03,Mr Mr chairman I think that it would be worthwhile right bring back in Jeff,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:10,Asher have him present the information on the growth of gone on arrivals and to allow Mr Morse the opportunity to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:16,respond to it at that time and everyone can have the same data beforehand and we can have a nice conversation about I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:21,think that that would be a best reason we'll do that at the next week okay my last my point about Mr Asher and his,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:27,data could be he and I Hindi and I self have agreed that we need to it's assured that we understand the data we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:33,looking at that what what I means and J means and P means that it means the time lapse of the crime I am more than happy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:39,to facilitate that if it's necessary facilitated I think it is thank you councilman Moreno then councilmember,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:45,Harris thank you Mr chair um I want to get a better understanding,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:50,of just how the task force operates if you could kind of walk me through uh how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:57,often do you all uh meet first of all right now we're meeting about every two week basis okay as a whole,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:04,but their individual task force members I meet with on a daily basis got it okay so the whole task force meets every two,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:11,weeks what about um agendas or or minutes from the meetings where where,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:18,can I find those are those available we definitely have agendas available we do not keep meeting minutes though,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:24,um it is a discussion amongst agency heads is not a dictation I mean it's just as if a staff meeting was happening,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:30,but we do have agendas okay um if you could send me those agendas that would be great I should absolutely,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:36,sure as a matter of record I know you made that request before I did ask for an opinion because I on the agenda they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:43,actually lists physical addresses and so I was looking for some guidance on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:49,should that be rejected or not um I have my answer so I'll be sending you the information wait go back so the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:55,agendas have physical addresses of who there's a property that has had a spike in violent crime or we believe is a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:02,contributor to Crime the address to discuss is listed um and so before I made that information,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:09,in public I wanted to make sure that I wasn't one breaking the law too that it wouldn't put anyone else at risk if we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:14,if if people knew we would jeopardize an existing investigation if the public knew we were looking at a particular,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:20,address that we know is that a spike in violent crime um but I have my answer now so you'll,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:25,get the agendas yeah well I'll say this I mean it's like I I talked to um whether it's the chief or other,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:32,members of nopd leadership About Properties where there is you know a spike in in crime all the time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:39,um and it's not divulged to the to the public if you're worried about it being you know uh a concern over a public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:47,records request or something like that you know talk to the city attorney's office to see if there's a potential to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:52,make that privilege but still send it to the council members I think particularly to the district council members who are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:57,not on the task force they'd probably like to know if there are specific properties in their District that are being discussed during the task force,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:05,meetings absolutely and again I I did just that and I got my answer from the city attorney's office so I will provide,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:11,the information that's requested okay thank you um tell me about the the data uh you talked a little bit about the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:16,data tell me about the data that you're collecting what you're looking at how does that work so again like I mentioned,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:23,before uh we really look at the data the police department puts out every week,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:28,um to see overall as a city instances of violence and uh and what's happening but we also,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:34,um look at calls for service data um you know how many times have we come to this this particular address,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:41,um again I mentioned the property of six thousand Chef we have been there 120 times this year alone so that immediately sent a trigger to say what's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:47,happening here um we have another property out in New Orleans these 256 times since January 1.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:52,so looking at those instances of just what kind of demand is it pulling on Public Safety agencies and understanding,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:58,the why behind that and so we also when we look at uh for example the major,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:05,offense law that comes out every morning um when all the major crimes that happened last 24 hours sometimes you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:11,start seeing repeat information when we have a particular uh instances of violence that happen in a small,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:18,um geographic location um we know I met with the office of gun files were mentioned staffs it says hey,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:23,can we help understand what's happening here they go out and speak to the community speak to the families they speak to the witnesses that are on the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:29,scene to see if we can understand a piece that maybe someone else is missing so when we talk about data it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:34,definitely driven around calls for service but I will say,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:40,um more recently the public has come to us to say hey we're not necessarily getting to that high level but if we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:45,keep going down this path we may get there so can we have a conversation beforehand and so we are starting to have those conversations we also some,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:52,members of the community have experienced violence I know one particular parent who lost her child to gun violence reached out to the task,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:59,force and say hey I need a support group where can I go and although that that particular piece,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:05,um doesn't necessarily stop bottling crime but wrap around Services it was important to us to be able to get that person to the services they needed so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:12,I'll say this like what you just um explained is actually good information and necessary,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:18,information that the public should know about I think I think that that that's a really good key role of the task force,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:25,to look at different areas of the city where example for example I think you said you had over 250 calls for service,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:31,for one particular area and it's like how do you how can you put all different types of City resources around what,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:38,potentially could be happening in that area I think that that's good um because I'll say this like looking through your presentation what you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:44,showed us is really presentations that we've already seen from other City departments like we've already seen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:49,these like we know about the violence intervention stuff from the health department we talked to safety and permits all the time we talked to the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:55,district attorney on some of the things that he's doing I mean so we've seen all of this and and you know it I feel like,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:02,you're kind of a a meeting spot which is fine for all different stakeholders to come together and kind of explain what,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:08,they're doing I think it's fine I think that's good I don't think that's exactly how the task force was you know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:15,portrayed to be or set up to be when the executive order was put together but I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:20,think that that it's good I think it's fine for for All City departments to to come together and talk about Public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:26,Safety I think more should be included to the Chairman's point about bringing all different city departments including,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:33,whether it's Oak whether it's Workforce or whether it's office of biodiversity all to the city council explain like how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:39,are you helping with the public safety issue that we deal with this I think it's long overdue that all different,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:44,types of stakeholders and City departments come together and have these discussions um you know I think we wanted something,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:50,to work a little bit more urgently not you know bi-monthly every two weeks but it's I get it I get it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:57,um let me also ask you though about uh Council participation when this was initially formed there were no council,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:04,members who were part of it two council members were then added to the task force which I think is great including,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:10,our chairman and and council member uh Harris so what about the other council,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:16,members or I I heard you know that apparently the mayor called for the rest of us to participate like what is are we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:22,supposed to be at the meetings not at the meetings like I don't I'm confused by that so council member immediately upon the task force being created I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:28,reached out to every single council member directly and asked for a meeting um and and and I those meetings happen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:34,with council members or their staff um with those that took me up on that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:41,offer um and we by all means we will continue to do that I know particularly we worked,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:47,as an individual council members direct daily in some cases around issues in their particular districts I mean just,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:52,tomorrow you talk about surrounding State departments we got a four block radius we're hitching tomorrow in councilmember Jerusalem's district with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:58,every state of Department um tomorrow to walk in and see what we can do to calm this area down,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:04,um and so I don't know no there's not an expectation for council members to attend a meeting I think the council,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:09,members are there represent the will of the council very well um in that regard but we can provide,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:15,updates to council members as you all see fit or if the task force needs to engage in your district and we will we will engage because I'll say this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:22,because I was almost like a calling from the mayor from the rest of us to participate and I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:28,certainly don't want to miss that calling and the direct quote was from the mayor understand that the entire New,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:34,Orleans city council can participate in any committee meetings that are held meaning by the task force that's the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:40,responsibility of the New Orleans city council mayor um Council vice president,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:46,let's give the whole quote right so the question that was asked to the mayor was can the council participate in this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:52,meeting today,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:58,right and so the question was asked at the press conference at Olive Street can the council participate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:10:04,um in that meeting and her response was any council member can intend that particular meeting that was the response,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:10:11,okay so can any council member let me ask you the question again can any council member participate in the task,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:10:16,force meetings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:10:28,you know councilmember Moreno I've said over and over again that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:10:34,absolutely can be inclusive right everyone every,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:10:39,stakeholder wanting to um Aiden the reduction of violent crime,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:10:45,deserves to see the table from a from a policy perspective I think the council,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:10:52,is represented but if you or anyone else wishes to attend a meeting we can have a conversation but I will not allow the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:10:58,meeting to be derailed or destructive um and so what that means is is that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:11:05,we have agendas I just ask that people stay on task um and that let me be very clear to you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:11:11,let me be very clear to you please the meetings that you are having there is nothing that can that can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:11:16,lead you to prevent me from coming to that meeting let me let me start let me,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:11:22,start there now if I am not welcome I get it I get it I it appears that I am,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:11:27,not welcome and and you pretty much just told me I'm not welcome let me answer my question more,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:11:33,clearly just accuse that I would derail to you I'm certainly not going to derail your meetings I made suggestions to you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:11:40,as to things that I would like the task force to consider and if my office participated in these meetings if we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:11:45,were welcome at these meetings we would offer additional assistance to you know move forward different initiatives that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:11:52,we see potentially lacking yes um and I think that those are voices that potentially would need to be heard but I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:11:58,get it but no you've made yourself clear you don't need to do any more explaining and and I appreciate your testimony thank you okay involved in respect,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:04,councilman Moreno I think just like we everyone in these Chambers these public Chambers has the opportunity to speak,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:11,um completely and give full of thoughts let me be very clear um my comments are in no way directed to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:18,you at all and so if that is how they were perceived uh then that's my apologies,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:25,but what I will say is is that just the fear fact that we keep mentioning that the council was not included,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:32,um on the initial creation of the task force okay we've had the discussion um we talked about the reasons why you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:37,thought and the correction was made right and so we we made sure that members of the council were represented,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:42,that is the the mechanism to ensure this body is represented if we need Fuller representation we can have that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:48,conversation and I understand that I'm in no way in a position to block someone,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:53,from attending a meeting I would never do that um but I just asked that anyone attending the meeting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:58,um allow the meeting to continue,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:07,before we get to the community cars and everyone has two minutes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:12,um if there were minutes and minutes were to reflect that uh my comments at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:18,the task meeting were in reference to understanding uh the hot spots that have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:24,existed for the last 30 years where they exist if you look at every,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:30,crime map whether it's the council crime map the Metropolitan crime commission crime map,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:35,other work done at the police department uh very few has changed in pockets of our community,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:41,whether it's crime from extreme violence or domestic violence,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:46,hijacking of simple robberies and one of the things that uh I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:52,recommended is that we look at those hot spots why have they been the same for 30,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:57,and 40 in 50 years why have those pockets of those communities been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:02,neglected in terms of how should they be resourced,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:08,so I think that the only way the violence reduction happens if is if we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:14,look at the Historical pattern of crime and where crime has happened and who it's happened to and you'll remember I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:20,made that recommendation and that at the end of the day the task force come up with recommendations based on what's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:27,happening in those communities that have either been neglected or been forgotten but historically what are the resources,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:35,we need what are the wraparound Services we need to go into so I would hope that a report at the end of the day uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:44,even if this committee is never ending but at some point uh there's a document,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:49,that's produced that represents uh the level of violence that happened that's happened in communities for far too long,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:56,and what we need to interrupt it or stop it so if there were minutes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:15:01,those minutes would reflect that I made that comment in our meeting and I'm expecting that at some point I just did,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:15:09,yes that is correct well I'd like to add an appreciation to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:15:16,councilmember Thomas councilmer Thomas will let you know publicly where those spots are he doesn't feel the need to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:15:22,hide those addresses and he at every meeting he also is happy to note and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:15:28,show his knowledge by telling us which gangs are out currently and that we should be targeting and should be trying,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:15:34,to pull back so part of the reason why councilman Thomas is such an effective,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:15:39,leader of this committee is that he publicly shares information and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:15:45,encourages people to come to these meetings and publicly sharing information to do buy-in what is very,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:15:52,concerning to me is that the only way we're going to address these issues and I appreciate our first presenters who,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:15:58,came up here and publicly talked about what the solutions were is we're going to have to invest resources and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:16:05,investment to tackle these issues how can we do significant investment of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:16:12,money based upon secret meetings that people can't get minutes to how are we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:16:18,going to take our recommendation from this task force when you're literally telling us you are not going to provide,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:29:50,crime going on in this city today and that is all public officials have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:29:58,not bought into doing what's necessary in order to attack the problem,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:30:04,it seems as if the mayor's office is not serious about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:30:10,addressing the crime problem this gentleman here is sitting here making excuses or or or giving us a Flim Flam,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:30:32,of public money we need to have people who are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:30:39,accountable in this city and obviously the mayor's office isn't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:31:01,attacking crime she needs to get her own plan the plan that the mayor is putting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:31:08,forth is not working and personally it can't work because it's not all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:31:22,so how are you going to come to a solution when you're not asking the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:31:48,with the Vera Institute of Justice I'm real quick councilmember Harris the Vera Institute has an initiative to End Girls,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:31:54,incarceration which recognizes that our young girls are one of our fastest growing populations in our jails and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:32:00,prisons I'll send you some information for opportunities to connect um additionally we were able to provide,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:32:06,a 9-1-1 calls for service analysis at Joe request council member Thomas both last year in April and in October we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:32:13,more than willing to continue to provide that analysis because I think when we're looking at that data we can really,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:32:18,understand what New Orleans police officers are responding to but also what new orleanians are calling help form,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:32:24,we've shared this information also with Mr Morris and we're happy to share it with the chief of police when we think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:32:30,about this issue of police not having um low enough or quick enough responses,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:32:35,to incidents of violence one of our approaches can understand that looking at the data of more than 300 000 calls,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:32:42,to 9-1-1 came through in 2021 about 70 percent of those calls were for what are categorized as public order maintenance,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:32:48,they're not necessarily incidents of violence I want to lift this up because we can actually do two things we can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:32:55,deploy officers to things that they are trained to be deployed and respond to while simultaneously deploying other,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:33:00,teams who are better situated and trained to be responsive to those issues and the last thing that I'll share in Mr,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:33:06,Morris's presentation there is some Synergy between the things that he was able to present and some of the things,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:33:11,that we presented yesterday regarding our requests for investments from arpa funds and fund balance specifically,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:33:18,those things are investments and access to more Transportation food stability,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:33:23,housing support and support for the office of gun violence prevention so as we're having these conversations about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:33:29,how we're approaching and tackling violent crime I just want to highlight those synergies between the things we lifted up yesterday and some of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:33:35,things that Mr Morris lifted up today thank you thank you those are solutions uh Miss Tony Jones,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:33:48,hello my name is Tony Jones I am representing New Orleans Community,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:33:54,oversea Police um you know this task force presentation kind of struck me as a bit unserious,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:02,um and I think like one a great example and this may not have been the task force,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:08,that led this but I'm I'm hearing a similar type of approach uh from this task force as nopd had with the decision,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:15,on a situation on Claiborne Avenue uh I live in the Treme and um you know as as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:21,you all know recently they started shutting down Claiborne Avenue and you know I'm expecting this to be coming,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:28,from a place where that you know violent crime is up or something like this but when I went to uh council member Freddie,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:34,King's uh Town Hall you know we have the first district uh police officers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:40,telling us that uh crime is down seven percent yet they're coming out of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:46,nowhere and shutting down kind of like uh black public life you know uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:51,this is like disrupting uh Commerce it's disrupting life and then when you ask them or when I ask them uh well how long,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:59,is this happening they have no time frame and so how this I'm just replicating the task force is that all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:06,the solutions proposed are all aesthetic it's things like what proposing commercialization of violence uh Broken,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:13,Window policing uh you know uh saying that apartment complexes are the the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:18,basis of this violence well to me all that to my ears I'm realizing that the pattern is what uh is being,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:26,pinpointed as the business of violence as black people that we are using all these different terms and signifiers for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:33,Crime when really uh you know all these Solutions I'm seeing a pattern just,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:38,harassing black people and it not being correlated to any any data because like with the situation on Claiborne there's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:45,no time frame for how long this police Crackdown is going to uh happen there's no data to support the Crackdown and and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:51,all those uh answers I'm getting are well it's it's value and disruptive so I think we have to look at a perspective,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:58,that uh that isn't just about harassing black people no thank you very much,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRgme-Yh1yg&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
