29:14:00,the end of the week so it's it's an issue with procurement or it's an issue with data okay well but they have a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
29:20:00,right but I believe in poor manager so once the it once Orion is paid they have to do some work with digipore digital,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
29:27:00,it's working through that but Orion cannot go through that next phase until their purchase order is paid I believe I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
29:33:00,guess it's in the city yeah I'm just trying to figure out what problems we can solve right now I think the problem that if the city could assist with would,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
29:39:00,be throw Ryan digicore is just working on there and that's something that's computerized something they have to take,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
29:44:00,care of because they haven't done that service before for us but once Orion is able to put it in so I think if you all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
29:49:00,could assist with Orion so that they can be paid so we'll try to assist with procurement I mean procurement is a big,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
29:55:00,issue in the city just generally um on the the electronic monitoring walk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:00:00,me through what happens currently because we're hearing stories from our nrpd captains where you justice involved,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:07:00,youth are on ankle monitors they dot the ankle monitors die aren't charged the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:13:00,kids are roaming around I mean this is what we're hearing is this do you think that this new system really I believe,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:19:00,that the new system would certainly be a lot more effective I mean So currently the system that we use and it's no,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:24:00,secret that we borrow monitors from the office of Juvenile Justice and so what they do is they allow us to borrow,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:29:00,monitors that we can place on the individual use I believe that every section is a sign that maybe five,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:35:00,monitors and what is the company that actually monitors this is through the office of Juvenile Justice you know the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:42:00,company that provides the ankle monitors I'm not sure how they actually monitor but the service that they provide as it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:48:00,goes through our intake we put the kid the kids on the monitor once those kids are placed on the monitor it's it's a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
30:54:00,system of wear um it's it's not immediate so if a kid has some type of violation or if a kid's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
31:00:00,monitor uh doesn't charge so they notify the court once the but they also notify,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
31:05:00,that child and so we do have a lot of I guess self-correction where if they call the family or the youth um but once they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
31:11:00,notify the court then the court has to make a determination of whether that child is in violation of that monitor and then to bring the child in but as we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
31:18:00,all are aware the problem is that we're finding out after the fact so it's not real time monitoring but again we don't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
31:25:00,have real-time monitoring so we're only using the resource that's available to the court and I just want to be clear,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
31:30:00,because I know there's been a lot of talk in the media in regards to these monitoring and and putting on our notice,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
31:35:00,about their ineffectiveness but for some of the kids um and some of the kids that just sometimes need a reminder we are finding,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
31:42:00,that it's effective but again for some of those kids if we're really trying to monitor their comments and goings if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
31:47:00,we're really trying to see um if they are not violating a certain uh stay away orders if they're not violating certain,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
31:54:00,uh matters that we're putting into place it becomes very difficult so we will find that a lot of those kids will still,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
31:59:00,be detained as a result or we'll find that some of those kids if they are placed on the monitor have to immediately be brought back in so I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
32:06:00,believe moving away from that type of monitoring certainly could be beneficial but again we've presented this to the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
32:11:00,council I believe on several different occasions and we're just trying to come up with other ideas you know that um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
32:17:00,that if this is not the best solution and this is something else another alternative that could possibly work and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
32:22:00,that would be through repair and repath is phone based right like it's correct it's an app on a phone that tracks,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
32:27:00,through GPS yes a child Abe cannot can talk a little bit more about that yeah,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
32:33:00,so it's an app on the phone but it's it provides real-time monitoring and not only does it provide real-time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
32:39:00,monitoring GPS it's interactive with the child so the child would have to uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
32:47:00,photo ID like check-ins um each person that's involved with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
32:52:00,youth at the time that a probation officer uh whoever you input into the app has communication via text uh they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
33:01:00,can call and you can set up the restrictions in the phone in the app so you can actually see,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
33:07:00,um what they're doing what they're supposed to be doing if they violate if they haven't done what they're supposed to do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
33:12:00,um it also provides you can set restrictions like zones where they can go where they can't go and it shows you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
33:18:00,if they step into a zone that they're not supposed to be in whoever is involved involved with the youth who's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
33:24:00,in the app they get a notification and you can contact them and you said other,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
33:29:00,jurisdictions are using this in Louisiana uh ojj is uh currently doing a pilot,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
33:34:00,program yes okay thank you and I believe it's also being used in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
33:40:00,Calcasieu as well as Jefferson Parish any other council members,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
33:48:00,another council members profile judges thank you guys for uh appearing um a couple of questions especially,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
33:53:00,about monitoring you mentioned earlier monitoring has kind of dominated the news lately every a couple of stations every,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
34:01:00,other week There's a report on monitoring as judges who are responsible,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
34:06:00,uh uh for that division of the Criminal Justice System,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
34:11:00,it's are these is ankle monitoring is it working at all and how would you guys rate it or or do you value it as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
34:19:00,something that's really helping or well I'm not answering would certainly be a great value correct and I think we've,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
34:26:00,been talking about this for so many many years about the right kind of monitoring so when no monitoring was available and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
34:31:00,we did not receive any funding for any type of monitor there was not any money that was placed into any of the budgets,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
34:36:00,for monitoring and I know there was conversation about whether or not nopd or the sheriff would assist or how we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
34:42:00,would actually monitor so what we did is there is a program that we started to utilize to the office of Juvenile,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
34:48:00,Justice where and when our kids are placed on a monitor sometimes uh once they are released either on probation or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
34:53:00,parole and they allowed us to use those additional monitors we did um and so by using those five monitors,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
34:59:00,for each section I think every judge has to wait you know which kid that they feel would benefit from that monitor um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
35:05:00,and so I certainly feel that it has been um I found that it has been helpful in terms of some of the kids who wanted,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
35:11:00,done I've seen him one time they had to make a better decision I released them on a monitor as opposed to detaining,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
35:17:00,them in at jjic to give them an opportunity to see how they could do in the community and they were a success,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
35:22:00,some of those kids were actually allowed to participate in other types of programs some of those kids um have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
35:28:00,moved out so when I look at my numbers of kids that I place on the Monitor and I've had successful resolution of their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
35:33:00,cases I had far outweighs what we see in the media so I know there's been some talk about a child who was subsequently,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
35:39:00,murdered while on a monitor as we are aware those things are completely and totally out of our control you know I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
35:45:00,have no control over things like that that happen but most certainly that is a very unfortunate circumstance but we do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
35:51:00,have some kids that I think uh benefit but do I believe that we have some kids that are I guess involved in far more,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
35:58:00,serious types of offenses that need a definite different kind of monitoring I believe that's accurate and I believe,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
36:04:00,that's where this repath would certainly make a difference so that brings me to a I was writing as you guys were talking,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
36:10:00,so it is monitoring more about reporting and less about crime deterrent no no,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
36:17:00,it's certainly about crime to churn but a lot of times I'm not certain if you know I don't want to believe that if I'm releasing a kid that they're going on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
36:23:00,another crime I'm really doing it so I can give that kid a reminder that you know there are a lot of people that are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
36:29:00,watching things that you're doing we're expecting you to make better decisions we're expecting you to follow curfew we're expecting you to go home you know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
36:35:00,the purpose of the monitoring is that we believe that that child would be okay to be back in society we believe that that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
36:41:00,child could perhaps go back into their family environment but we are monitoring to help them make better decisions to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
36:48:00,make certain that they don't violate curfew that they're not in areas where they're not supposed to be um that they're attending school but they're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
36:54:00,attending certain appointments but the monitoring after 30 days if it's effective in 30 days we know it's done well and those kids are removed and if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:01:00,it's not effective in 30 days then we'll wear that as well so how do we determine,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:06:00,I get to a point where as you said we have effective monitoring so what is it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:11:00,based on your experience what is effective of the right kind of monitoring look like because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:17:00,um if you know and I don't judge the news about everything but we just mentioned that there's several very,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:23:00,violent crimes that have been committed where the perpetrators have monitors I believe the last uh issue that was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:30:00,discussed in the video was a young man who died with the monitor but again um you know I I will talk about the kids,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:35:00,who I have seen that have been a success on the Monitor and we have seen some but I believe that effective monitoring and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:41:00,monitoring that really um because again we want the kids to believe that they are being held accountable and I believe,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:46:00,that if they're watching the news that they currently are aware of some of the concerns and issues that we all have with our current monitoring so I believe,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:52:00,for our far more serious offenders that um obviously are waiting for their opportunity to go to court are being,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
37:58:00,released for different reasons or have may have had an opportunity to um to get back out in the community that we need,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:04:00,something uh that can have a little bit uh I guess more tea um in in it and I believe that this is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:09:00,where we would look at a more effective monitoring position and that's something that's real time monitoring the moment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:15:00,that kid has moved out of a certain situation there's an alert the moment that kid is not where they're supposed to be they're being contacted they're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:21:00,being you have to use face recognition they have to check in currently we're not do that is not possible through the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:27:00,monitoring that we have so we certainly believe that a more effective more um I guess a stronger type of monitoring,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:33:00,uh would certainly be beneficial and that's why we have suggested repad and Josh other thing that was obvious was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:39:00,you know uh and I think you know earnestly so is that your your,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:45:00,frustration for the request puts yes issue we're always being admonished for for not showing up there's this meeting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:52:00,there's that meeting there's another meeting on Friday there's a meeting today and again we are elected officials,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
38:57:00,and our first obligation and our first duty is to the citizens of New Orleans and it's to conduct the court docket,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:04:00,that I have in front of me and so when we continuously are being requested to come and talk about the same thing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:09:00,provide the same information give the same letter make the same requests and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:15:00,we don't have anything that's changed since we spoke to you all in February since we've been speaking about this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:20:00,monitor for at least the last 365 days or more and always if the fingers of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:25:00,being pointed goes right back at the judges and what we didn't do well here it is in black and white we have given to you all to the council to the mayor,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:33:00,to the commissioner what our needs are what our requests are and we're just asking if everybody would just take a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:39:00,moment to review and see what they feel would be effective yes and perhaps see,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:45:00,whether or not whether it's funded through juvenile court whether it's funded through another office however you get these services in place that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:52:00,this is what our children need and this is what our community needs for us to have safer and better outcomes okay so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
39:58:00,let's walk down that road then we're trying no no I think it's a perfect opportunity,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:05:00,to do it uh so here are something to a conversation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:10:00,I think you got to look at all these things together because as a judge you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:16:00,only can make a decision on what child is best to go back out in the community based on the information you have in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:21:00,front of you and the record of what that child has done may not reflect what what,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:27:00,is really going on with that child that's why this assessment center is so important so we can know the mental health needs we can know what else is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:34:00,going on with this child so you have to have all these things together it's not one thing that's going to be the the the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:39:00,the magic you need to look at everything together um not only that making sure you have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:46:00,the entire Community surrounding this child the school you know all of these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:51:00,other the church okay the coaches you have to have everyone around this child,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
40:57:00,to know this child has special needs and how do we uh monitor that child through Community monitoring not just through,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:04:00,the ankle monitoring program or any other court program we all have to get involved in and and not just try to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:10:00,point fingers so I just had to add that for the time no first of all thank you Jessica look I think you guys are a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:16:00,wonderful we have some of the best uh judges in the world but what Jonathan,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:21:00,talked about is process if you can be an All-Star but if the process doesn't support your Splendor,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:28:00,then you're just an All-Star wandering in a river without coordination you know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:33:00,without consistency so I think it's important that we go that I had a retreat with my office yesterday so how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:39:00,we can better time management how we can better deliver Services how we can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:45:00,better service constituents because no matter how good I may think we're doing I know that people are still frustrated,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:52:00,and I think that my office can do better and we can do more so we had experts to come in to try to help us maybe better,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
41:59:00,and my staff would be better but I wrote some things down because I think your,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:04:00,frustration is warranted in many cases uh there are other committees in their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:09:00,meetings right we try to get a lot done before we come here when we come here you want to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:15:00,report to the public what was done or what wasn't done and I think you've done a good job thanks of of airing that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:21:00,there's a criminal justice coordinating Council right there's nothing prohibiting uh the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:27:00,administration uh the the commissioner and other components of the system getting together,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:34:00,before you have to come here and report that it wasn't done to get those things done so my question is when we started I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:42:00,started a year and and a few months ago the conversation was about communication and coordination or lack thereof,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:51:00,so it seems to me that the conversation is still about communication coordination,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
42:56:00,or like thereof what role does the criminal justice Coordinating Committee play and why haven't we been able to use,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:04:00,that committee where all of the stakeholders get together so that those questions that you've been trying to get,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:11:00,answered those resources that you've been trying to get dealt with that we haven't built some consensus around them,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:16:00,already does the committee not work is it dysfunctional do they not me yeah I mean,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:24:00,because I believe it's the committee yeah it's just about time management and I believe just everybody reading what we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:30:00,provide and perhaps uh responding to those requests and I believe it's also of who needs to attend,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:37:00,certain meetings um I think there's sometimes requirements on elected officials the judges to attend certain meetings where,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:43:00,it just becomes very difficult with time notice it's certainly important um we really don't get proper notice to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:48:00,a lot of meetings um it's very difficult when you have a court docket and I believe that people don't understand that not only having a court doctor but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:55:00,having to prepare I've been in this job for 14 years almost and I have never,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:01:00,been invited to as many meetings as we've been discussing the same issue over and over again as I have been you've been listening to me and I would,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:07:00,just certainly encourage everybody just to read their emails and to read the information we provided we've seen the same thing over and over again so we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:13:00,going to say it again today we need an assessment center we need monitoring and most importantly as well we need Court,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:20:00,notify I think we've been asking for for several of these things but the one thing I want to I want to clear up because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:25:00,I know the chartered pretty good I've been around a little bit right in terms of specific duties roles and and and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:32:00,functions and responsibilities and though some may want it to operate outside of what those Charter,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:37:00,responsibilities are I think we do that because of the public I think the council's kind of played its role in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:43:00,terms of it now with funding that's another thing but administering coordination,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:48:00,what the system has to do amongst itself that ain't my job,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:54:00,that's not this counselor's job this committee is just for you guys to come here to report to us what's been done,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:00:00,within the system what are the needs within the system and how do we help with our Charter role which is clearly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:08:00,defined so I just don't want the public to think that if nothing else this body,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:16:00,isn't playing this one now when you talk about funding if there's some things that we we could have done or should have done then that's a meeting with us,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:23:00,but when you talk about coordinating with criminal justice the commission uh yeah I believe within the system that's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:30:00,another step that needs to happen that should happen oh yeah public meeting oh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:36:00,well I believe all that's certainly happening and I believe that so again we provided this information to you guys in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:41:00,February we've been providing information so I would agree that that we are certainly providing any information all information that we can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:48:00,um and I believe that we are attending as much as we possibly can I think we're also sending Representatives so we are certainly engaged and committed and will,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:55:00,continue to provide the information that we can to the council I have to get to a try my my court is buzzing me like crazy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:00:00,but I do appreciate the time of being able to speak with you all today councilmember Morrell uh thank you thank,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:07:00,you for your presentation today uh just getting back to the issue of ankle monitoring,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:12:00,one of the biggest complaints we get about ankle monitoring is that and with juveniles is that there's a lack of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:18:00,enforcement with violations of ankle monitors and I think it'd be helpful to helpful,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:23:00,to us that that's the direction we're going to go in if you guys could agree to provide the aggregate data on ankle,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:29:00,monitoring violations to show that that is or isn't a correlation does that make sense yes okay so just if if we're going to go,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:36:00,that route I think that we need to have that data on how many violations are occurring if ankle monitors are going to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:43:00,be used that's all thank you thank you and another thing it's just to clear up confusion is that uh if if there's a way,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:50:00,where this committee or this Council uh can help clear up maybe some of this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:57:00,frustration around you guys continuing to come before us and continue to have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:03:00,the same laundry list then I think that's direct communication or consultation with us it's not just to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:08:00,being CC uh uh on on the letter on an email but saying hey look guys in the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:15:00,role that y'all play you guys can help check this box off the list and I think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:22:00,we're more than willing to do that okay thank you very much thank you so much because we have the August meeting and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:27:00,so we do appreciate the timely notice and I believe that judge Smith uh will be able to attend so and we're going to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:32:00,also just try to spread out which judges attend so it probably won't be all of us and that's of no disrespect to anyone,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:38:00,we're doing that as well as with the Commissioners meetings we're just trying to have one judge that's present if at all possible and if not we're also set,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
47:44:00,in representation representatives of the Court well we want to respect your time and what you do that's important okay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

49:47:00,beginning of May and we did about 18 total trials in the month of April and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
49:53:00,um I guess I'll say the community has been responding to their jury summons but there's always room for more uh in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

50:18:00,million dollars for jury Renovations and I think all of the council members did visit the courthouse to see the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
50:23:00,conditions of the jury office we were through an email working with commissioner jeruso that council member,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
50:30:00,jeruso and we were told that that money was dedicated for criminal court jury repairs since then,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

51:34:00,council's attention today because that is something that that we need to help us um run our courts and and be able to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
51:42:00,move forward on jury trials in an effective and efficient manner so that's why we wanted to bring to you that need,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
51:49:00,that um is still outstanding did you get a notice that the 5 million would be reduced to one point we didn't receive,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
51:57:00,any notice at all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:02:00,and so just to keep moving on uh and so uh deputy chief Tracy so I'm in zavalier,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:07:00,is just going to update you on some of our court intervention services and what's going on with them,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:13:00,all right so according to intervention services as you all know uh pertains to all of the programs that the court runs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:20:00,um most notably of the last couple of times we've been here we talked about our DV specialty court and so we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:27:00,working on a DV specialty Court in conjunction with Tulsa Oklahoma which also has a DVD specialty Court currently,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:33:00,all of the judges oversee a DV docket basically or receive DV cases and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:38:00,explain to the public what that is domestic violence or domestic abuse battery thank you um and so all of the judges have those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:44:00,types of cases and so what we're trying to do is develop a specialty docket for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:50:00,those cases that have been um have gone to disposition so the person's either been they've been convicted or they've,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:55:00,pled guilty and so we would have a special DD docket where judge lumbar would monitor the misdemeanors and she,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
53:02:00,will talk a little bit about that and judge Veronica Douglas has agreed to monitor those uh felony probation cases,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
53:08:00,that are high risk other judges might still maintain the those probationers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
53:14:00,that are on probation for domestic abuse battery related charges but the high risk ones would go to Specialty courts,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
53:21:00,um in Orleans Parish and then we would increase that as the need um increases as we know domestic,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
53:27:00,violence unfortunately continues to increase and so we continue to work with the City of New Orleans with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
53:33:00,Department of Health on protective orders issues on the transfer of firearms issues and on the various,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
53:41:00,issues that are are outlining and pertaining to domestic abuse battery in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
53:47:00,addition our judges uh judge Lombard and judge Veronica Douglas will be visiting Tulsa Oklahoma,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
53:52:00,to view their specialty court and then members from the Tulsa Court will come,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
53:57:00,to New Orleans um to talk to us and judge lumbar can add anything else yeah so our goal is to hopefully have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
54:04:00,this up and running by the end of the summer we're going to Tulsa in June and then they're coming in July hopefully to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
54:10:00,help us set up our system right now the majority of my docket is actually domestic abuse or domestic abuse related,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
54:18:00,charges like an AG assault as a part of a DV so um we're hoping that creating these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
54:24:00,specialty courts quite like drug court will stop the recidivism and help us to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
54:30:00,um as as the previous judge said one and done seeing one time get them through these programs and hopefully never see,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
54:36:00,them again and one of the reasons we're focusing on that is during covet we did see a rise in DB cases and so that this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
54:44:00,is why this program is is a priority and so we will come back to the council if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
54:50:00,we learn that there's a a need for more monies in our budget to to make this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
54:55:00,happen but but as of now we that is not the request but we just wanted to let you know that this is a program that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:02:00,uh planned on starting uh as soon as possible,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:07:00,and I guess that would complete our presentation as far as things that have changed since we last appeared before,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:14:00,the council council members questions councilmember Harris the uh entry issue is resolved right I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:22:00,think we talked about that the last time the site entry for the Za South White Street yes okay perfect,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:28:00,um again I'm concerned about this missing uh 3.9 million dollars I would probably,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:35:00,yeah we were hoping that the city council could assist us we didn't receive any paperwork the city,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:41:00,council member jeruso informed us at the meeting that the money had been allocated by the city council after the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:47:00,uh we left the meeting up obviously I was interested to figure out what documentation we needed to move forward,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:53:00,how we would move forward so we hadn't heard anything for several months we reached out to uh Vince Smith with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:59:00,capital projects who wasn't aware of any allocation being allotted to Criminal Court uh he looked into it further and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:06:00,then we got a call from one of the capital project managers who,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:11:00,said that they would be working on this and that funding was allocated at 1.1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:16:00,um we do have a letter um that's been drafted to the council,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:22:00,but specifically to council member jeruso who we have been in contact with about this particular issue,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:29:00,um so we will be following up and writing yeah so the court sits in my district and I know that there's 1.1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:34:00,million dollars in bond funds available and maybe there that's where the confusion is is that he's talking about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:41:00,Bond funding and we certainly have prioritized the jury rooms because everything that is not in my district,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:48:00,has to do with government buildings and nothing fun um but yeah we've got we prioritize the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:53:00,jury rooms and I think it's 1.1 million dollars but if there's another additional sum that we've allocated,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:59:00,separate and apart from that please reach out to council member jeruso um you can copy me on it as well again,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
57:05:00,because the court sits in my district and I know it's a priority I believe I copied the entire Council for the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
57:10:00,original letter to Vince Smith I know yeah the whole CC situation is is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
57:15:00,problematic so as you heard from the previous presentation if you all want to address letters directly to us just,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
57:22:00,adjust them to us and don't CC us because if we need to take action especially budgetary action then you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
57:28:00,need to let us know immediately and just pick up the phone and call that's sometimes probably easier thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
57:34:00,thank you the judge is one of the topics of conversation that in the previous,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
57:39:00,presentation as well as uh publicly have been about monitoring judge Anderson,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
57:45:00,mentioned the best time kind of uh monitoring and you guys you and the time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
57:52:00,that you've served what is the type of monitoring is should we have and what's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
57:58:00,the most effective use of so if I can speak from the past I would,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
58:03:00,say what I believe worked best was when we had opso monitoring you understand,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
58:09:00,the way it stands now if a judge orders a defendant to wear an electronic,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
58:17:00,monitor we do not suggest we do not recommend we do not advise which program,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
58:23:00,they should use which entity and so I think that would be the best way I don't remember when we appeared a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
58:30:00,central program you're saying yes like if nopd or opso could monitor it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
58:36:00,yeah if we could have law enforcement right now that's not not how it stands it works better years ago when opso was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
58:43:00,handling it and so I know you guys have questions about how uh this electronic,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
58:50:00,monitoring work and unfortunately there are a bunch of questions that we cannot answer because we do not run the program,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
58:58:00,just so let's be clear yes we had a program that in right used to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:04:00,work or worked better than it works right now wouldn't and who made the decision to go,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:11:00,to a program that doesn't work uh that is not as effective as the one that you remember,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:17:00,that did work well what I do know is that uh Sheriff Guzman was in office at the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:25:00,time I believe the budget was cut and he said our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:31:00,office is not going to handle it anymore so for years um councilman Thomas there was no,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:36:00,electronic monitoring as crime started to plummet uh there are several bonding,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:43:00,companies that decided that they would um offer electronic monitoring so when a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:50:00,judge as I said before requests a certain defendant to have one they go out and choose which company if it is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:56:00,the bonding company that they're with or is another bonding company they cut their own deal for minus one no,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:02,so okay so a couple of things with the electronic monitoring one is for any,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:09,program um judges or precluded or recommending a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:14,for-profit program for service as you already know so several years ago there were stories about particular judges,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:21,maybe recommending a program that they were familiar and comfortable with because we cannot recommend a particular,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:26,program then what we say is this is the bond for example one hundred thousand,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:31,dollars on a particular Crime Of Violence if you post this Bond before you are released from ojc which is the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:38,New Orleans Justice Center you need to have also electronic monitoring in place under these conditions 24 7 which is 24,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:46,hours a day seven days a week you may have a curfew there may be exceptions for work doctor's office Etc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:52,um in those cases then yes the defendant then has to go to a monitoring company that monitoring company then needs to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:00,connect with the Sheriff's Office and then place the monitor on that particular person at the sheriff's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:06,office before the person is released and the documentation and paperwork needs to be provided at that time that's if a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:13,judge places an electronic electronic monitoring as a condition of a bond release most of a lot of our cases are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:21,not ordered by the judges so a number of the electronic monitoring orders that are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:28,given are given directly to the defendant by the bond company itself,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:33,because the bond company says we are only going to write this particular Bond if we can monitor you regardless of what,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:41,the judge says I'm sorry yes in their best interest so sometimes when the monitoring companies,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:47,are saying that there's a lack or absence of information it is on those types of orders the orders where the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:53,bonding company enters that private agreement with the defendants and they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:59,are not receiving or getting or gathering the information that they need when a judge orders the orders the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:04,electronic monitoring everything is put into a minute entry it's put onto our bail order all of the information and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:11,all of the exceptions and requirements Etc and so for those of us listening if I'm following you right,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:17,the in the past there were questions about ethics but a program that worked,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:24,so now we've addressed those ethical issues and we have a program that doesn't work no I think what you're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:30,saying in the past we had the sheriff monitoring it at some point due to budgetary restrictions but just Sheriff,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:37,stopped okay then we had no monitoring then we went to a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:42,system where as judge Davila just explained we set a bond we set the conditions and then if they post that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:48,Bond they're fitted for an anchor monitor before they leave at one point there was issues with judges selecting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:55,or recommending programs that we felt more comfortable with right so now we have a standard policy we do not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:02,recommend the program so we just so there's a classical question has been dealt with correct but now that means,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:07,the defendant chooses whichever Bond whichever monitoring company and bonding company they choose that doesn't work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:15,it may work sometimes it does work um and then it just that's a heck of a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:20,question mark when you talk about it okay let me say this it often works but again like judge Henderson just said we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:27,can only look at their record the crime that they are charged with and why we are monitoring them so for DV cases I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:34,often choose to monitor because I want to put give the victim a key fob to make sure the defendant can't go near the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:40,victim that's my reason for monitoring them so if I give them the permission to go to work and then they go do something,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:45,else while they're at work that it's not that the monitoring system didn't work it's that wasn't the purpose of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:52,monitor well I mean but the answer is the question I mean especially for us sitting here you know you're not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:58,criminal justice experts and many of you remember something that was a lot more,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:04,efficient and work better you know Rob Masson and I talk about the past a lot,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:09,of stuff that used to work and why don't we do it uh anymore and now we enter,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:14,into a system that maybe dealt with the ethics and dealt with the question marks but isn't as efficient as what we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:22,remember no sir and so and so so one of the reasons we're here as I've,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:27,said in the past we've asked for this we've asked for the money to be put in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:33,either the Sheriff's Office budget and opd's budget our budget so that we can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:38,get back to in a length to an ankle monitoring system that works whether or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:44,not nopd or opso has the manpower to do this as they did years ago we don't know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:52,but when you ask what is effective that is what is effective breaking news,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:58,councilmember king um if if possible we have representative from each nopd and all the inspired,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:05,Sheriff's Office so they can let us know right now if they have the the manpower to assist sure we'd love to know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:12,no okay nopd doesn't have the Manpower,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:20,Sheriff's Office this is easy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:29,there's a sheriff's office have the manpower to assist with ankle management,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:36,but not given the last vote,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:42,the sheriff's trying to raise money to increase the department has the manpower to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:50,assist with monitoring the ankle monitors which is exactly why we're in the position that we're in and so it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:57,just needs to be made clear that when a judge orders a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:04,electronic monitor for a particular defendant we do put in place some,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:10,conditions when a Bonding Company says that a particular defendant needs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:18,to have an electronic monitor as a condition of their bond for their company the only thing they do for the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:25,most part is they remain in state a judge is going to do more we're going to give them a curfew we are going to set,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:33,other conditions and so I just need the council to understand that a lot of times when you hear from this company,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:39,and they're telling you that they did not get sufficient information from a judge on a particular defendant who they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:47,have placed on an ankle monitor it's because judges may not know that that is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:53,the condition that the bonding company is requiring if a judge does it we are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:58,going to know the condition not if a bonding company does it for whatever reasons they decide to place the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:05,defendant on our electronic monitor there is a difference well I I just don't understand why we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:11,wouldn't have a central system uh and even with the Manpower and labor,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:17,issues if there's a central system then that could be worked out amongst the different entities in terms of what are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:23,you what resources and what level of labor you need if it's just uh any and everything goes and you don't really,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:29,know what how labor intensity intensive it is uh how many people we would need from the sheriff department or the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:35,police department so how do we get fact so I think the question is well I'll go back to the other question,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:42,yeah cultural morale just really piggyback on what our councilman Thomas was going,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:49,what prevents y'all from doing an RFP being a horse centralized ankle,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:55,monitoring company so it's a few things prevent Us in addition to obviously the funding but we are not a law enforcement,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:01,agency we don't have and we can't hire officers that are post-certified to do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:08,arrest or violations because basically when the electronic monitoring system was initially set up in juvenile court,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:15,and in Criminal Court simultaneously you had the sheriff's department best practices we met with a number of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:22,different groups and I think it was Mecklenburg they came down they provided us with their policies and procedures we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:29,looked at the monitoring system the GPS system and everything and the key was to have law enforcement that had immediate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:35,and certain acting authority to go out and to make arrests or remands or remand,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:41,someone if there was advice it's really a bifurcated issue so you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:48,we all agree you would have the authority to do the RFP for the ankle monitoring but it's challenging to have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:54,the ankle monitors and have no law enforcement Authority who's tasks with going out and arresting the people who,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:02,violate the ankle monitoring so right now the reason why the stop Gap measure which is not ideal,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:09,is the bonding companies is because when they make it a condition of the bond a bond agent can go out there and arrest,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:15,someone for violating the conditions of their bonds so basically we are in a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:23,position unless we find a solution where we're basically relying on Dog the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:28,Bounty Hunter basically for all practical purposes so right now ankle monitoring,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:34,because of the shortfall and the inability of law enforcement agencies to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:39,work with y'all we're relying upon the bail bond agencies with varying results to work with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:47,judges to establish whether or not an ankle monitor is a condition of a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:52,bond and then I guess the other question which judge Pittman brought up which is very interesting and also very logical,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:59,is what happens when the bail bonding company has other conditions or requirements it puts on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:07,top of the ankle monitoring that you're unaware of or vice versa that you have things you want included that they just,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:13,kind of disregard for example if you have judge lumbar who gives very,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:18,specific instructions for a domestic violence a person gives you domestic violence you cannot go near these three,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:25,businesses and we rely on a civilian agency to do ankle monitoring and they don't input,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:31,that specific information because you don't really have authority over the bond company you're kind of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:37,hoping that they do follow the order but as a law enforcement agency well as the fact they're not a law enforcement,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:43,agency they're not really required to do it that person when you revoke them and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:48,find out they were there you can then deal with them but that's on the back end not the front end where ideal Echo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:54,monitoring would have the moment that person violates your order a law enforcement agent will be dispatched to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:01,arrest that person this current process doesn't allow for that because Dog the Bounty Hunter doesn't know all the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:07,conditions because it's not he's not necessarily required to know all the conditions because the person is being,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:13,ankle monitored based upon their agreement with the bond company correct so when we do it we we give them,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:19,a key file so the victim in DV cases and in some other violent crime cases has a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:25,key fob so that the defendant goes within a certainty Zone then it's picked,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:30,up immediately but again that's if if judge dably or judge Pittman or I put it in ourselves and we have an order and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:37,all of that is in the system but if the bail bondsman does it none of that happens because it's happening,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:43,post-relief correct okay well I mean this is this is probably a problem that is going,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:51,to require money and enforced conversations with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:57,the law enforcement agencies to work with the judges to figure out how we're going to address it because I do think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:04,ultimately this needs to be centralized with y'all and you would agree as well but unless we have a law enforcement,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:10,agreement that you're going to have specifics law enforcement agents tasked,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:17,with going out when a bond is revoked it's useless so that's that's what that's the impasse right now I'm sorry,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:23,if I'm walking through the logic but I'm trying to make sure that I understand everything that's going on okay and like,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:28,I said we've had the same discussion right before shift uh Guzman got out of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:34,office and they were supposed to be looking into uh the possibility and the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:40,capability of being able to bring that program back from years ago but again,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:45,there's been a change of guard and there's been no discussion uh between the entities uh since that time yeah,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:52,that's unlike washes thank you well I think and that's why it was importance of this discussion because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:57,first of all when we're talking about crime in our community we understand uh labor and Manpower but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:07,given the level of violence every answer can't be just because we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:12,don't have enough people that might be one of the answers but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:17,that can't be every answer and it's obvious especially for folk who've been around,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:23,that something is awry with this in the reporting and it's also obvious that the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:29,criminal element given the level of violence has been associated with monitoring whether it's victim of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:34,perpetrator that the criminal element doesn't respect dog at all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:40,period so there has to be a whole nother level or something else done to get to at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:47,least if you're going to have us have a system then it ought to be some respect,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:53,attached to that and it seems that we don't have that right now so then my,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:58,other question is and it's everybody who comes before this is committee the question from day one has been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:05,coordination communication and how everyone in the system works,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:10,together is that coordination and communication better now,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:17,uh is the criminal justice Coordinating Committee is that are we filtering some,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:22,of these issues through that committee so they could be because I think some of these answers to these some of these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:27,questions should happen before they come here because at some point it would be good for the public to hear you guys,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:33,saying hey no we dealt with that in that committee and here's how we solved it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:39,so what is the status of how do we assess coordination and communication uh for me a year and a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:47,four months later so I guess my response would be that communication is definitely better than,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:53,it was I will say that there has not been further communication uh amongst the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:00,entities in regards to electronic monitoring if you're referencing that specifically but but how can that be on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:08,every station and in every Barbershop and beauty shop and there isn't a level of enhanced,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:14,communication around it this is something we're using within the system sure and and I will say that one of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:21,reasons why I believe there hasn't been further communication is exactly what,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:26,you just said we don't want to hear it but this is what we keep hearing a lack of manpower,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:32,there's a lack of Manpower and nopd there's a lack of Manpower at opso I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:37,mean we were asked earlier about uh council member Harris how's this going with 619 South White what I can say to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:45,you is that it is better but has it fully been resolved Council councilman Harris no it has not we're still dealing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:53,with sometimes someone's Manning the 619 South white door sometimes someone isn't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:59,so I hope that answers the question every time we seek the assistance that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:06,we need it's the excuses lack of Manpower yeah but if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:11,this is there's a certain level of violent crime attached to a segment of the system,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:20,especially where people are being killed arrive the murder then you adjust,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:27,to stop the violence on that particular end that's what I would think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:34,which is why we haven't set dormant which is exactly why the electronic monitoring process that's in place is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:42,still in place because we feel it's better to do something that's working to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:48,a certain uh degree then have nothing yeah but if Jack the Ripper has a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:53,monitor monitor and he's still Jack the Ripper ring,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:58,what good is the monitor well and allowed to freely continue to rip I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:04,guess part of it is is that we do there are a number of defendants who are still,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:09,in custody for those uh most serious violent offenses they are in custody the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:14,theory of prevalence is happening with monitors they are not they are the ones that are in custody on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:21,the jurisdiction of criminal district court and understand the jurisdiction of criminal District Court is adults and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:27,those that the D.A chooses to charge as adults and so we look at those who are the offenders the offenders in which we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:34,have jurisdiction over from Criminal District Court are in fact in ojc they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:40,are not the ones that we are talking about with respect to electronic monitoring our our colleagues on the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:46,bench are very clear about the types of offenses that they are willing to allow,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:52,people to um post bonds and then receive an electronic monitoring and for those that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:59,are the most serious most dangerous ones or alleged most dangerous ones they are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:04,at ojc they are not subject to electronic monitoring,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:09,councilmember King well I thank the judges for clearing this up absolutely because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:16,um we get often you know first thing some the first times,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:21,there's mention of a shooting or killing the media says that oh by the way this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:27,person was on the ankle miles and it makes everybody it puts everybody in a bad,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:32,like police judges council members everybody like how is this possible now,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:37,we see that there is a a reason for that and not to say that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:42,it's your fault because it's clearly not been OPD doesn't have the Manpower then,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:48,they can't they can't make somebody is pop up and do it and same with the um with the sheriff's office I don't want,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:55,to mention their names in public seem like I'm advocating for them but there is a company that uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:03,proposes to have the ability to monitor this to solve the problem of the ankle,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:08,monitoring um I guess maybe offline we can get you the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:15,name and see if that's doable that's that's reasonable if they fit the criteria that's needed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:22,if uh yeah yeah but but I mean your comment actually lends itself to uh the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:29,material problem is that here we have a public conversation around what has been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:35,a public conversation around something within a system that doesn't work right so it would seem to me that as part of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:42,the Criminal Justice System it shouldn't just wait to come before this committee,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:47,for Council people to make recommendations or to hash out problems with something within the system that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:54,doesn't work and council member members of the system would be and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:00,somebody who could help you guys because I think you guys have been public but knowing what works and what doesn't work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:07,it would seem to me like those assets within the system would have met with you guys and say before you go before,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:14,that committee here's how we fix it I just want to add that for the most part and I guess we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:21,could get the stats on that most Criminal Court is not overwhelmingly using electronic monitoring okay it is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:28,not a system that we rely on and so while um it may be relied on by Juvenile Court,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:35,for various reasons which I think we all understand um in addition to the population or the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:41,the capacity that they have at jjic as well as the fact that they're dealing with juveniles Criminal Court by by you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:49,know conversely does not rely largely on electronic monitoring so the issue for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:55,us has not been as prevalent as we have as you see with juvenile court and so I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:01,want to make that clear as well we are utilizing the resources that we have in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:06,other ways so ojc which is the Orleans Justice Center um you know higher bonds for the more uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:13,violent offenders revocation of bonds Etc a number of the people who are at OJ C are also on probation holds or parole,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:20,holes they're also facing other charges so we have a smaller population that's really subject to electronic monitoring,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:27,in criminal District work and if I could just add this um as I said,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:33,the question has to be asked as to if the judge placed the person on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:38,electronic monitoring or if the bonding company is requiring as a condition of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:44,their bond those are the times when you do not see any conditions you won't see,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:49,a curfew you won't see things of the sort nine times out of ten the only thing they say when the bonding company,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:57,is ordering the electronic monitoring they're asking or ordering the defendant,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:02,to stay in the state of Louisiana so when individuals are getting in further,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:08,uh or involving themselves and further criminal activity the question has to be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:13,asked was the electronic monitoring ordered by the judge or the courts or is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:19,it on a defendant because it was ordered by the bonding group I think that goes councilman Morrell's position there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:25,could be other criteria that the judge placed on that defendant that the uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:31,management company doesn't care anything about no as long as they're in the state commit crime correct councilmember,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:38,Harris uh yeah I mean I think this is an interesting discussion I think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:44,technology has advanced where and I know the company that council member King is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:26:35,um a couple Melanie's going to run through our PowerPoint briefly and we know you all will have questions a couple of highlight items we just want,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:42,to cover today um 10 years ago when the police and Justice Foundation took on the assistance in the recruiting area we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:48,never dreamed that we would still be doing it uh these many years later we know there's been discussion of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:54,transitioning it back to nopd or using an outside company and we are more than willing to help with looking into how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:01,that could work and how we could help in the process um the uh there are two two components,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:08,of recruiting and it's important to acknowledge the difference there's marketing which is generating,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:13,applications and then there's actual hiring which is fostering an applicant,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:19,through the process of taking the civil service exam and eventually becoming a new hire,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:24,um The Cooperative Endeavor agreement that we have at the city the funds are almost entirely used for the marketing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:30,portion of that process a year ago we did hire two new recruiters to help with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:35,the uh process so they are doing more in the um in the hiring stage but those two,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:41,employees could be transitioned back to nopd at some point and turned over to the nopd payroll,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:48,um but we just want to stress the difference and Melanie will cover all that as she walks through thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:56,so to begin with these are the seven obligations of the New Orleans police,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:01,and Justice Foundation pursuant to our Cooperative Endeavor agreement and I'll touch on each of these briefly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:07,but first here is a visual of the obligations of the New Orleans police Justice Foundation pursuant to the cea,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:14,nopjf the foundation that is is responsible for the top of the funnel which you see in red and a small portion,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:20,of the lavender portion of the funnel which is the conversion of applicants to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:26,test takers for the New Orleans Police Department so first our first obligation is the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:32,website when we started this process approximately 10 years ago the process to join nopd was a paper process we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:40,promptly took that paper process to one that is digital created join nopd.org a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:45,website that website is now the responsibility of the City of New Orleans we do continue to monitor the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:51,site and assist in uh the city's I.T Department as needed on website improvements and problems,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:59,the police and Justice Foundation is responsible for advertising and for driving qualified candidates to the join,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:06,nopd.org website we do that through a variety of ways including active Outreach as well as passive marketing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:13,and behavioral targeted displays,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:19,active Outreach might include Military Support sites such as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:24,I just forgot the name of the the publication of Veterans Affairs issues,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:29,Regional law enforcement support sites such as iacp and employment resources such as job boards,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:38,and then passive marketing we do it we nopd has on occasion attended job fairs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:44,as well as some other overarching not not quite so targeted but overarching,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:50,advertisements to focus to persons who might be interested in joining the New Orleans Police Department,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:30:06,college-educated military and of course qualified residents of New Orleans at this point in time 24 of our applicants,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:31:12,cea developed marketing materials that would be digital as well as traditional media,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:17,background investigations there was a time when nopd's background investigation unit was not in a place to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:23,process applicants efficiently and effectively at that time in partnership with nopd the police and Justice,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:29,Foundation did Outsource that that project since that time nopd's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:34,background investigation unit is in fact quite quite capable of processing applicants efficiently and effectively,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:40,so we no longer have that outsourced contract and all of that has been brought in-house,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:48,direct recruitment this of course is direct contact with applicants candidates for the New Orleans Police,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:32:26,transportability study was performed to determine if we could change the then civil service exam that that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:33,transportability study was successful we have a new civil service exam in place and National testing officially kicked,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:39,off May 1. and I'm sort of a catch-all any general,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:44,related support activities that the police department might request of us and if it's in our budget and we can go,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:50,ahead and perform those functions we are we are happy to do so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:55,and that again is a quick recap of the seven primary obligations of the New Orleans police and Justice Foundation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:01,pursuant to the cea and once again the visual with nopjf being responsible for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:07,the top of the funnel and having some responsibility for the lavender portion of the funnel converting test applicants,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:14,to test takers we do have here some historic data applications test takers and hires keep,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:22,in mind the 2023 projected is a trend line that is based upon the performance,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:27,of the first four months of this year and of course it could change,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:34,again some historic data applicants test takers conversion rates by year including test to higher rate and again,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:41,2023 projected as a trend line so those numbers could change but they are currently based upon the performance of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:47,the first four months of 2023. and a budget to date beginning April 1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:55,and ending 430 of 2023 of expenditures by the New Orleans police and Justice,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:36:22,specifically dedicated to any particular effort I can tell you today approximately 398,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:36:30,000 of the total 900 has been spent on advertising in general with an additional 54 000 contributed by the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:36:36,police foundation for a total of approximately four hundred and fifty thousand dollars in advertising I don't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:36:46,are being done because I was told that the efforts were not good it was it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:36:52,could be better to Target um these students in and coming out of I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:36:58,think the um three in New Orleans two in Baton Rouge I think maybe one in Shreveport,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:05,the six hbcus in the state of Louisiana um they could do a better job of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:10,recruiting those students and seeing how half of them are within an hour of this of nopd,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:18,so we have attended some functions at some of the universities across the state we don't put a lot of effort in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:26,job fairs I'll tell you that historically the return on investment of job fairs has been zero so much so that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:32,we don't even get sufficient leads to make the investment in the job fair financially worthwhile but we do Target,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:41,digitally across the state as a for instance if someone comes if there's a big event in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:47,New Orleans for instance Jazz Fest then we can geo-target that part of the city and we can hit those people so we do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:54,more things digitally than we do the old-fashioned way we were in in working,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:00,with Lieutenant Merricks who is an HBCU graduate on an HBCU program since his,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:07,not being in recruiting I don't know if he's on sick leave or if he's been transferred I'm going to defer to Mr Mr,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:13,White to finish that for me I believe he's out on leave at the moment as my understanding okay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:19,okay um so we have of course why you classic,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:24,coming up um which is a big draw for for students Essence yes to some degree Essence but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:31,I'm talking about like kids they're not kids but you know that college age um if we can make a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:39,I'm not saying you are a more of an effort to really hone in on those students coming out of college,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:46,um who are down in the city we're looking for looking for a job we want to live in this city,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:51,um if you can do that that'll be great absolutely right the way his that we usually do that that's not to say,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:57,there's not room for improvement but the way we usually do that is through is digitally so if we for instance at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:39:02,Essence fest if we focus on the the Geo Target of the Superdome or the convention center where there is a large,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:39:08,number of people gathered then digitally on their cell phones and on their social media feeds they will start to see join,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:39:14,nopd join NOP PD advertisements now I will tell you not everyone in the room,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:39:20,here will necessarily see it on their social media feed they are targeted to a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:39:25,degree so if you are outside of the target population that we happen to be interested in then you may not see it on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:39:32,your social media feed so this is a suggestion um it may be too old school but if there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:39:39,is an event um can we get a tent or a table set up saying nopd is hiring and we go put that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:39:46,right in the smack dab in the middle of the why you Classic parade route just on an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:39:52,idea that people can't miss it physically absolutely we can absolutely,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:39:58,do that ideally there would be if the city could find it uh for us to be able to do that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:40:03,without an expense and then we could put monies I would think we would need handouts or something that's more traditional then absolutely you know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:40:10,sometimes job fairs can be expensive and I understand that it's an industry like any other but to spend a couple of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:40:15,thousand three thousand dollars on a table and to take people out of the office and and send them to a job fair,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:40:21,only to come away without any applications or any leads is really something that we have to look at so we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:40:26,always weigh the return on investment for everything that we do and we are of course always flexible if something's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:40:32,not successful then we're going to go back and do something else or try something new and what not what's not successful today may very well be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:40:39,successful tomorrow so we always have to keep an eye on those things and be flexible and ready to change thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:40:45,from Harris I I want to go back to return on investment so according to and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:40:52,your slides aren't numbered but and I can't really see but you spent about 773,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:40:57,thousand dollars since the cea was executed that's correct and you're expected to yield a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:04,projected yield of 73 recruits was that right,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:10,so I would defer to well that is the trend line as we have predicted it yeah,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:15,but I would defer to the to the nopd on the hiring piece as we are at the front end of the funnel pushing applicants,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:22,into the top of the funnel and helping to a degree with the conversion of applicants to test takers but once that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:28,stage ends it is the responsibility of the police department to push everyone you know background investigations and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:33,get them into the account I'm just going off of the information on your slides so 773 thousand dollars spent since the cea,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:40,with uh the next slide projected yield in 2023 of 73 hires correct so that's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:46,about a hundred thousand dollars per hire that you're spending to yield 73,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:53,recruits ten thousand ten thousand okay ten thousand okay sorry that's okay I'm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:59,a lawyer and lawyers to empty math um so ten thousand dollars per crude is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:05,that is that typical do you have any data to say whether or not that's typical I I do not have any comparison,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:12,data no does anyone up here there's historically it's not cost that much,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:19,um it's an incredibly competitive environment as I'm sure you're aware um we're spending more now than we have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:25,in the past with that being said there's a high level of interest in the nopd um I think we will be able to convert,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:32,uh hopefully a significant number of applicants into into hires but that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:38,requires the team to work together and and do more than we've done uh in the past uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:45,recent past anyway she got us back to where we were pre-pandemic what does that mean for the team to work together right,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:51,well this is a Cooperative undertaking with nlpd so we can put people into the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:57,pipeline and we have to work with nopd then to result in ideally more than 77,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:02,hires and that number fluctuates like for for right now it's fairly low because we just started a class I'm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:09,going to probably have a bit of a lull while they process people for the next class you'll see that number probably jump,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:15,again around the point where the people who are currently in background transform into hires no one's been hired,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:22,since the April class began several people have been onboarded but the class will start even the next their higher,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:29,date as we're tracking on the on the projection will be when they set foot in the classroom you know that day and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:35,there's a couple different ways we can measure that if we went if we ran the numbers by onboarding dates then you'd have a different projection for this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:41,year but not everyone who's onboarded makes it into the classroom so in the interest of being accurate we report on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:48,hires I would expect that number to jump I would hope that number could jump um and historically we've we've been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:55,able to do more with those numbers than than we are currently but then I think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:01,we will do down the road okay I still want to get back to the ten thousand dollars per higher uh assuming that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:09,actually yield 73. can you pull any comparative data from any other police agencies on recruitment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:16,and provide that to us in the future that would be helpful just just for us to see you talk about return on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:22,investment you talk about money spent we certainly don't want to spend ten thousand dollars I mean that number,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:28,could actually if we get half of that that means we're spending twenty thousand dollars,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:33,sealed half of what you're projecting here and that just seems like a lot of money for recruitment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:41,um spend well and we might break it down at some point as well advertising versus,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:46,program expenses versus other so your program expenses are going to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:51,those are sort of going to remain uh static not quite but sort of so that approximately a hundred and eighty seven,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:58,thousand dollars in program expenses Hardware software things of that nature okay yeah I know I'd like to see a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:03,breakdown because I again this is money that I don't want to throw good money after bad especially if we could,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:09,incentivize um these recruits with a payment rather than you know spending ten thousand,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:15,dollars on Impressions um the question about working together I saw the Cleveland ad,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:23,any everywhere else is Cleveland is that the ad that you all produced we did produce that ad yes did you run it by,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:30,any sort of nopd focus group to see if that would uh make a good impression a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:35,bad impression once the ad was produced we don't we turned it over to the New Orleans Police Department we did not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:41,post it we did not take it down no no that's not my question in producing that and coming up with the concept of you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:47,know folks dancing around this police officer did you focus did anybody focus,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:52,group to make sure that that would actually form a favorable uh impression of nopd and yield recruits did you run,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:46:00,it by any current police officers to say okay this is the concept that we're going for through storyboards whatever,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:46:06,before was produced to see if this was going to be appealing to someone who's currently on the force,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:46:12,so we did not do a specific focus group okay we did not produce it unilaterally as that concept was being developed it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:46:19,was being developed in partnership with the with people at the New Orleans Police Department that was the prior Administration the concept came into,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:46:26,being somewhere around the fall of last year and then production video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:46:31,production actually got underway I guess around the December date and then once it was edited and ready to go again did,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:46:38,you preview it for anybody at nrpd to say oh how does this feel to you you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:46:43,know this is like advertising 101 right you do focus group to figure out what what's appealing to recruits,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:46:50,you produce something and then it's possible that you edit it based on an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:46:55,unfavorable or favorable impression did you run this ad once it was produced by anyone at nopd or any any current,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:47:03,deputies I would say the people who you're attracting to nftd once the ad was produced it was provided to the New,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:47:09,Orleans Police Department we did not then instruct or ask we were not involved in a another focus group type,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:47:16,situation we turned it over to the New Orleans Police Department and that's and then it was posted and then it was taken,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:47:22,down so I guess the answer to my question is once it was produced nobody on your side ran it by any focus group,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:47:29,deputies to see if this hit basically we did not we provided it to the New Orleans Police Department that I mean,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:47:36,that's a problem right I think that any time that you produce something that is targeting a particular segment that you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:47:42,need to run it by the segment that you are targeting I mean again I worked in college I wasn't in admissions but I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:47:49,worked at Loyola and we would run by advertising to our current freshmen to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:47:55,see if this would be appealing to the Freshman coming in because they are the person that we were trying to Target and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:48:01,again as you talk about collaboration as you're talking about spending ten thousand dollars per recruit maybe,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:48:07,you're going to yield 73 maybe you're not you have got to collaborate with nopd especially the rank and files to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:48:13,make sure that this is appealing to them I saw that Cleveland ad listen I'm from Ohio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:48:18,it I was like what is going on it it was just so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:48:24,bad and bizarre and you know if I were looking at the ad if I I just didn't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:48:30,understand it and I don't know that anybody would be attracted to nopd because of it how much did you spend on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:48:36,that advertisement do you remember the question it was approximately twenty seven thousand dollars twenty seven,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:48:42,thousand dollars again I I think having some input from new recruits the new classes uh the commanders the captains,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:48:50,to say is this something that is going to be appealing to the people we're trying to attract is is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:48:56,is necessary we're gonna turn this trend around so the the ad was actually produced based on feedback from the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:49:04,current Academy class classes about a uh a culture shock aspect to working in New,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:49:11,Orleans okay and a loss of outside applicants who came into the city not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:49:16,knowing what to expect and not knowing what to expect from the department and we're overwhelmed and therefore uh you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:49:23,know we're less likely to stay potentially yeah that I mean I I live in New Orleans I'm not from here,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:49:30,as people know but there is a culture shock coming here but that doesn't that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:49:36,ad was just fat I don't know that it encapsulated that culture shock or I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:49:41,would just say that subsequent to the production and and airing of the ad we've tightened up our marketing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:49:48,um procedures and we are engaging to work more closely with nopd on those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:49:53,type of things we've also brought on an outside firm to give us some outside of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:49:58,the cea funds on our own funds to give us some uh recommendations as to how we can proceed better on a marketing basis,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:50:04,okay are you guys um advertising on a national basis yes and you're advertising on a regional basis,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:50:12,um I've seen a bill I've seen one billboard I think as we come from the West Bank into New Orleans but I will,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:50:17,tell you that I've seen more Billboards in Jefferson Parish advertising for Jefferson Parish uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:50:23,police force that I've seen for New Orleans advertising for New Orleans and I get the Billboards aren't the most,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:50:30,attractive thing it's more passive advertising but but if we're talking about return on investment and seeing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:50:36,and reminding people they are important to some extent so how many Billboards do we have that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:50:41,you all have funded under this current cea we have not funded Billboards under the last cea we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:50:48,did run Billboards for approximately six weeks from mid-june all the way through the end of July in particular to catch,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:50:54,the essence vets crowd that might be driving in from Texas or Florida so those Billboards ran across the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:50:59,Mississippi Gulf Coast in the current cea we have not covered the cost of billboards but we did work with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:51:05,superintendent's office to post 23 Billboards across the city of New Orleans okay the cost for that was 60,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:51:12,000. that did not come out of the cea right we're we're trying to figure out a way to pay for those outside we're not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:51:17,going to pay for those okay there were some locations uh in Jefferson Parish and on the expressway right I mean we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:51:24,right you're advertising to yourself if you're in New Orleans but maybe you should go to Jefferson and some other jurisdictions on lateral focus and I'm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:51:31,going to ask um a superintendent wood Fork about this too are we targeting laterals at all are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:51:37,you targeting laterals at all with this advertising Cooperative Endeavor agreement does not cover laterals and we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:51:43,have not been asked to engage in lateral advertising or recruitment okay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:51:50,um on the Civil Service and removing barriers I'm glad to hear that may one people can test remotely that's just for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:51:57,the civil service exam correct that's correct and what about the physical exam they still have to come into New Orleans to do the physical exam they still have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:03,to come into New Orleans but we would like to see that that overhauled and perhaps remote Physical Agility,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:09,introduced into the process yeah I mean everything is remote right now and that shouldn't be a big barrier so I would,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:15,encourage y'all to focus on figuring out that um and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:20,what other incentives are you all hearing that officers and recruits would find meaningful are you hearing any,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:27,feedback from from the The Funnel of okay this is why I've dropped out I mean that was important in recruiting is like,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:33,figuring out why someone has dropped out of the funnel so Kevin I'm going to defer to you on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:39,that so we we routinely speak with the incoming classes to assess their uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:45,their recruiting experience and we do collect feedback from them we're very but that's after the yield that's after,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:51,the incoming recruiting class it's after you've yielded that class I'm talking about the people at the top of the funnel you drop out Midway are you are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:52:59,you talking to those people who have dropped out of the funnel we routinely speak with people who dropped out of the funnel as well and what are they saying,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:53:05,a lot of it has to do with the cost of coming to New Orleans which is why we continue to try to move things remote or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:53:11,online uh some of them do receive competing job offers more quickly um so that's something that we are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:53:18,constantly focused on being fast being responsive but we win a lot over other,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:53:23,departments by basically providing better customer services people in the academy right now that apply to the NYPD,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:53:29,or Chicago Police Department and they're here instead um and it's all we often win because we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:53:35,take better care of people when they come here to do that so that's a constant a constant source of of an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:53:42,advantage that other departments larger departments struggle to to recapture and it's sort of a unique Advantage for us,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:53:48,do you go back through the top of the funnel people who had jobs out to retarget them,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:53:55,yes to re-engage them that's a a great thing to bring up at the moment because with the new uh civil service exam,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:54:01,anyone who's failed the Civil the old civil service exam is eligible to retest anyone that's interested in doing that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:54:07,absolutely should reapply reaching out to all those people now um there's people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:54:12,occasionally reapply on their own and there's Outreach throughout the process uh when when people drop out to try and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:54:19,bring them back into the funnel it tends to be more periodic part of what we're looking at is that a hot application on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:54:25,the desk that just came in that day is worth an awful lot of money right so as much as and I think councilmember King,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:54:32,mentioned going to job fairs and things like that if you have about 2500 applications so far,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:54:38,it's good to go to job fairs and see if someone else is out there potentially but you want to work on the 2500 that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:54:44,are on your desk of people who've gone through clicked on the website filled out the full application indicated that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:54:49,they want to be part of this what about people who have partially thought of an application do you ever go back and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:54:54,figure out what the issue is or or retarget your efforts to the people who have partially completed the application,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:55:01,there's a screening form on the website a sort of a pre-screening form that encourages you to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:55:07,reflect a little bit on what you're going to be asked on the road and if you know you have things in your background that are probably not going to work out,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:55:13,then just think about how much you want to invest in this effort and all of the screening form submissions,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:55:20,are tabulated periodically reviewed do you have a a way to see if there's a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:55:25,point in which somebody stops filling out the form the application is the application the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:55:31,application I do not have insight into because it's hosted on a separate platform platform called neogov that's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:55:36,managed by civil service neogov has uh relatively limited ability to track,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:55:42,through Google analytics and so actually what we're seeing is you know people clicking the apply Now,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:55:48,button on join nopd after they submit that form and from there we kind of lose who actually feels yeah you don't have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:55:53,visibility yeah and that tends to be depending on the application Source one,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:55:59,out of every four people or so about 8 000 people have clicked apply so far over this cea period and we have about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:56:05,2500 applications so there's an awful lot of people you know along the way who got really close now this is is a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:56:12,shopping funnel almost like Amazon right so the the more just in the basket right yeah but but that's my point is like,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:56:18,can you figure out who's in the basket can you and you're saying with the Civil Service software you can't figure out,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:56:25,who has an OPD in their basket to put it to your Amazon not as efficiently as we ideally could,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:56:32,if everything was on the same platform this is a discussion that we are having with civil service with uh nopd about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:56:39,platform Integrations and things like that this is just a constant work in progress you use Salesforce to manage,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:56:45,the applications Civil Service users Neo gov to track the applications Salesforce is a better platform I I I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:56:52,mean it just is uh and you can see where people stop and say okay this is a problem at three quarters of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:56:59,application through maybe we do something different with this application we don't we don't use neo-gov but we have been very happy with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:57:05,Salesforce or what we've used it for okay with that being said one of the campaigns we have is an active,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:57:11,retargeting campaign for people who have visited the site and then left without completing the apply now click so I mean,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:57:17,this is a constant process of refinement and honing and going back to people we know that not everyone wants to do this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:57:23,and we are looking for people that want to be police officers but more importantly want to be police officers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:57:29,in New Orleans specifically and those are the people that we're going after and targeting to council member King's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:57:34,Point earlier Salesforce also allows us to go back and organize lists by someone with a college education who's applied,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:57:41,in New Orleans who comes from a community that we're looking for bilingual speakers something,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:57:47,like that military background and prioritize Outreach and phone calls to those specific applicants because 2500,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:57:53,applications with five recruiters is an awful lot to go through yeah um so it's it's a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:57:59,you know there's always room for improvement but it we have been able to produce results,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:58:05,that I have not been able to buy from other people all right thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:58:10,councilman I'm around I've got,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:58:15,far fewer questions um than that well I'm not from Ohio so I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:58:21,don't have to deal with all the Ohio memes that my kids were teaching me about the Ohio Means so I'll talk to you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:58:26,later about that um I appreciate that you guys are considering getting out of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:58:31,recruitment business I think that it is very difficult um to kind of have a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:58:38,full responsibility for recruitment when they're two different organisms both,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:58:44,working on it on either side of a of a wall and trying to sync up properly and I think it's part of the reason why as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:58:51,you all know the council is hiring someone to do an audit and it's just generally speaking not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:58:56,so much to be a gotcha but more to be looking over this 10-year period even,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:59:02,further where were the successes and failures with recruitment in general because something we get constantly from,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:59:10,individuals whether they be on the street on the business Community is if there are so many different companies,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:59:17,that just do this why are we doing it and if it's something that we look at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:59:25,objectively with the third party coming in doing an audit and they can find that something that's weren't us continuing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:59:30,to do let's figure out for a way to make it work but let's also put on the table that maybe it is something that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:59:38,should Outsource to a group just to do on our behalf I can tell you as someone,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:59:44,who's who works with law firms who both get calls on a daily basis to either,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:59:49,head hunt existing lawyers or sell a law firm on lawyers looking for a job,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:59:54,that the market for finding people in employment has gotten increasingly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:00,aggressive in particular with law enforcement because as you know there's a supply and demand issue and that there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:06,are more officers in demand than they're on the pipeline to fill positions and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:14,the no fault of yours or even necessarily nopd,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:19,that market has aggressively evolved to the point where I talked to people who,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:25,said police officers are caught up there with nurses at this point where if you are in a department and you're unhappy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:30,and you call the right person they'll find you a higher paying job at a different department and if we're not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:37,using those tools to aggressively ourselves recruit those individuals,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:42,across the country who are looking to make a move we're missing an opportunity and so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:48,I just want to kind of get your renewed commitment as we try to figure out what we're going to do with recruiting I know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:54,that I think we're gonna I think there's a review right now going on the two responses we got to the original,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:00,proposal for an RFP for recruitment auditing we should have someone selected,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:05,and up for a vote in two weeks for the council meeting when that person is selected I'd appreciate y'all working,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:10,with them to figure out what we should do going forward so that's all I have yeah absolutely you have 100 our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:17,commitment and our cooperation as uh Ms Beau said in the beginning we never dreamed we'd be in this for 10 years and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:24,over the course of our 10 years we have all met with and discussed with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:30,organizations to whom these efforts be they in whole or in part could be outsourced to and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:36,what would that look like and how much would that cost so we have continuously gathered that sort of data in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:42,anticipation of turning this over to the city and to the New Orleans Police Department or to some other organization,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:48,that is that is it exists to do this work okay thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:02:00,here and that you um are working in a very difficult area I'm a bit disappointed because one of the first,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:06,things or early that I was asked to vote on was to expend taxpayers dollars on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:12,three important areas one was hiring people through the foundation who are going to follow up on every application,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:18,also the second thing was um working to make sure that we could,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:23,have remote approvals of physical exams and also the remote testing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:30,it doesn't sound like we're there on either one of those in terms of the total follow-up that we were going to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:35,have and I want to be a get clarity on what you envisioned or envisioned,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:40,relative to following up with applications I understood that we were going to get a phone call for example to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:45,persons who applied to find out what happened in the process and I'm not necessarily assessing blame I'm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:52,accessing assessing a bit of disappointment just because I thought that we were going to have that and please is there a disconnect between,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:59,what you do and the ability to follow up on applications by phone by email or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:06,other forms of communication follow-up of applications is distributed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:12,to recruiters who are both working for nlpjf as well as recruiters who are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:17,working for the New Orleans Police Department so those that obligation is distributed amongst all those people which I think now is five which is now,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:25,5'3 on the New Orleans on the nopd side and two on our side so though our two,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:31,Personnel have been in place they were hired mid to late August of last year so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:36,about a year now they have been assisting nopd with that with exactly that process of contacting applicants,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:43,and encouraging them and shepherding them through the process to the civil service exam so give me the number on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:49,applicants again how many applicants have there been for example in that period And I know it's in here but yeah I want to ask you a question as to how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:56,it works yes the cea period to date we've had about 2500 applications,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:03,so you divide up the follow-up with the police department and how do you determine the follow-up of those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:09,applications the assignment of um applications to recruiters is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:15,conducted by the New Orleans Police Department we the police and Justice Foundation do not play a role in how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:21,those opportunities are assigned I'm going to ask the police the chief of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:27,police when she comes up so I'm gonna get more clarity but the police and Justice Foundation does not follow up with the applicants we do when the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:35,applications come in the 2500 and those when those applications are then assigned to recruiters for follow-up,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:41,recruiters within police and Justice Foundation yes all recruiters we are not involved,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:48,in the assignment process so those applications come in and they are then,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:53,distributed by the recruitment staff of the New Orleans Police Department to the five recruiters included in that number,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:59,of five are the two Personnel that we hired with the Cooperative Endeavor agreement funds okay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:06,based on what you've done what what have you seen in terms of applications why we haven't had more go through the process,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:12,to become police officers so I think that goes to some of the some of the comments Mr White made earlier,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:18,just a general what what well I mean for example there's there's paid there's a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:23,cost of relocation there's taking them that's taking the civil service exam in another city now we say that we're going,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:28,to solve that problem that's taking the physical exam I ask I am asking kind of a general question as to how we can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:35,improve that by asking you that sure so currently the the the target is to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:43,convert one out of every four applicants into someone who takes the test some will pass some will fail then they'll,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:49,move through the background investigation process some will pass some will fail ultimately out the end will come the number of hires that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:56,need because the one out of four have been working so that was 100 that would be 600 applicants to have taken the test,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:01,right so the one out of every four we were very close uh at the end of March uh about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:08,24.9 percent uh conversion rate going this year so far we put in an awful lot,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:14,of applications in April 450 um and in April we we did not quite we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:20,we're we're working on scaling that to the point where we can do that with 450 applications but with that being said,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:26,the conversion rate this year has substantially improved since hovering around 20 right now we're seeing strong,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:33,work this month so I I think there's conversion to test taking conversion to test taking okay after that also for the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:40,public to understand sure yeah so so after the conversion a test taker The the applicant is is handed off to the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:46,background investigator and that's sort of the end of the involvement of the recruiter uh now with that being said if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:52,we have trouble reaching the person or something uh the recruiter often at that point has a relationship with them can text them can call them and and they can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:58,help uh but but the recruiters are focused on the top of that funnel there taking those applications 2500,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:04,applications and converting it into test takers and that's that's been a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:09,significant drop off for us and it's a significant drop off for everybody but it's one of those areas where a very,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:15,small Improvement just a couple percent could have a large impact on the back end and it's not got anything to do with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:22,changing standards lowering standards anything like that it's just finding the people that applied and encouraging them,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:28,to continue through the process so that's what the recruiters are primarily focused on that's largely where our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:34,efforts have been focused as well and with that being said I know um someone earlier maybe councilman Morelli,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:41,talked about working on both sides of a wall with nopd we communicate daily we text each other,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:46,we call each other we have meetings weekly the the relationship with nopd,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:51,especially over the last few months has been hand in glove uh to solve some of these problems and with civil service as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:58,well you know there's been things in the past that have been sacred cows and and those are gone I mean anything that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:04,needs to happen we can bring up with them and get a response now do we always agree no not always but we always talk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:12,we hash things out we revisit them down the road we look for places to improve our recruiters work out of their office,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:18,Alex is there almost all the time I'm there usually at least for the weekly meeting if not more often,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:24,um so it's a very close relationship now ultimately we contribute that top part of that funnel but the working,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:31,relationship is I would say pretty strong right now do you see more enthusiasm amongst applicants,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:36,I see uh I see an interest in the New Orleans Police Department that had,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:43,sometimes ebbed and sometimes flowed but I've seen interest now uh that has not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:49,always been present in the last year or two uh and I think that there's a very good chance that this is a very,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:54,different year and that's you know no small part to new energy in the recruiting office brought by some,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:00,changes that was made on the nopd side and by A Renewed commitment I mean the focus of this organization too you know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:06,certainly doesn't doesn't hurt to make it a priority that was a good headline statement and I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:13,want the media to jump on that you said that there's more enthusiasm um well that's my word enthusiasm but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:15:52,foundation has expanded uh over the years from what's its original uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:15:58,Mission wise into this area like we're talking about recruiting and retention uh know that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:16:05,recruiting uh and retention is going to be the centerpiece of every discussion we have but anything that has anything,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:16:12,to do uh with the police department uh and their ranks uh labor was a question,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:16:19,earlier when we talked to juvenile court uh it was a question when we talked to Criminal Court about monitoring and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:16:26,having someone to do with the monitoring given that issue so I would hope that all the different components that have a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:16:31,relationship with nopd uh would be ready to address what are they doing to make sure uh we have more labor,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:16:39,more man and woman power uh on the police uh Department uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:16:46,The Cooperative Endeavor agreement these seven uh areas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:16:52,if you guys would could rate those seven areas especially after 10 years of an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:16:57,agreement which areas are you good at which ones would you say especially that you want,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:17:03,to get out of recruiting you want to get out of that piece you know you're looking forward to getting out of there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:17:09,which areas what are your strengths what is the foundation good at and where have you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:17:16,added value our digital advertising there's some traditional media in there but the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:17:22,digital advertising has produced a significant number of applications as many as 7450 in one year I think that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:17:30,have performed well in that market yeah we'll be on the website right um the website you said oh you want me,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:17:37,to take one two three four and move them around yeah no I know I just didn't see the word uh digital oh I think we are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:17:44,most effective at advertising,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:17:49,National and digital that would be it advertising I think would be our number one okay and perhaps something that's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:17:55,not listed here that that I think we do a very good job of and we really is is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:18:00,Mr White and now Mr Kalinda is you always need someone sort of to act as a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:18:06,manager right and so we monitor the website and if there's a problem with the website we notify City I.T we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:18:12,always looking at the marketing and the advertisements if an ad is doing well somewhere or not doing well then,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:18:17,immediately we can pull it and push it to somewhere else so you sort of an overarching keeping an eye on everything,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:18:24,that's involved in the process and obviously our uniformed officers have a lot of Duties that go beyond this effort,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:18:31,so in the event something's come up that perhaps they might not be aware of because they have been on the street for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:18:36,12 hours or they have been told for another shift for some other reason that we can get involved or we can try to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:18:41,help we can work with the civilian staff who think that's that's a big part of what we bring to this whole process is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:18:47,just an overarching keeping an eye on everything and being able and willing and available to help whenever help is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:18:54,needed whether it's Monday through Friday nine to five or it's nights weekends and holidays uh councilwoman uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:00,Harris I think was was very good and very thorough she actually I asked a lot of the questions and got responses to a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:06,lot of the issues as well as councilmember king I think that people were concerned about but she talked,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:12,specifically about standards a recruiting uh you know there are law enforcement uh foundations and our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:20,organizations that have principles of uh recruiting from from Perth to International,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:26,police Chiefs there are certain six five or six standards uh that they use when,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:32,you talk about recruiting retention as well as other law enforcement issues so y'all ever use any of those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:37,recommendations that come from Purge for the other police foundations when you're looking at recruitment and retention or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:44,especially working with nopd because those standards are Universal we do routinely have discussions with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:52,national law enforcement agencies such as ICP and Perth as well as I I many times attend the iacp conference as far,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:59,as police foundations absolutely I have a robust relationship with police foundations across the country there are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:05,about 200 of us maybe a little more than that not many of them are very small and some of them are only are strictly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:11,voluntary but those that are larger and that are involved in recruiting we do have discussions with and we also keep,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:17,in touch with other law enforcement agencies I think metro PD in Washington DC would probably be at the top of that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:23,list and as we travel around the country whether it's professionally or personally we do engage in some of those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:29,conversations to find out what's working for other people and then you know the last thing I'm going to be consistent,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:35,with especially at these quarterly meetings with every agency that's part of Criminal Justice System because I'll,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:41,go back to uh the first time we got together when there was an issue about coordination and communication it seemed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:49,like there would different silos or different parts of the criminal justice system that they were operating in their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:54,area but not much coordination and communication within the system in general so how would you rate that level,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:01,of coordination cooperation and communication now our relationship with the New Orleans,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:07,police department now is as good as it's ever been we have uh Mr Kalinda and Mr White have weekly meetings every Monday,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:13,with Lieutenant Powell recruit stat is getting ready to kick off under the leadership of deputy chief johnette,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:18,Williams I routinely talk to Chief Landry sometimes the superintendent is on the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:24,phone call in our conversations as Mr White noted Mr kolendik reports for Duty,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:30,almost daily to the the office at 1515 poetry where recruiting is located the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:35,two staff persons we hired with the Cooperative Endeavor agreement monies they report for Duty and they work side,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:40,by side with the New Orleans Police Department recruiters that I think that our relationship is very good and continues to grow and improve every day,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:47,well along with Recruitment and Retention I'm going to continue to ask that question because all I know is what,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:53,worked and we have we have a road map when uh crime was cut 63 percent double,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:59,the national average in this town uh when the murder rate went from 100 and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:22:05,424-159 uh there was Major cooperation amongst every agency within the system,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:22:12,uh I just don't understand why there's so many question marks when we come before these public bodies,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:22:18,about stuff that should be worked out all relationships that should be working to resolve them before they get to these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:22:26,public meetings you know it would seem to me like every agency ought to come well we got,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:22:33,together last weekend we answered that question well well we got together this week and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:22:38,we figured out this is how you do it within the system but it seems to me every time we have these uh meetings especially about crime,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:22:45,which is the number one issue in our community we're still asking questions of the system that it would seem to me,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:22:52,like the system should have worked out amongst themselves you know I believe the D.A bone is connected to the police,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:22:58,department bone is connected to the criminal justice bone it's connected to the juvenile bone it's in all of those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:06,bones make up a skeleton that's functional but it just seems like something want to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:11,arrive over the last couple of decades and we're all trying to figure out how everybody whose mission is should be the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:17,same to get on the same page again well I can tell you as it relates to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:24,recruitment our mission and that of the New Orleans Police Department are definitely well I don't think anything ought to happen with the police,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:29,department or for the police department where the police department isn't the foundation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:34,of it are helping direct it I don't see where somebody should be sent in to save us a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:42,system in that part of the system isn't principle and how you set up those Commandments,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:49,that it should live by and I just see some areas where we still,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:55,have a long way to go when you talk about cooperation and coordination and in many cases a respect for individual,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:01,agencies but I appreciate what you guys do anything y'all want to add before we close out I'd just like to express our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:44:21,on um the allotment of new hires and new recruits I assume you're looking at um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:44:27,districts that are hot right now as far as allocating new recruits or are you doing it for rata well um we looked at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:44:36,it and my thing is I think we take the seven district for instance it's definitely a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:44:42,bigger area bigger did one of our the biggest District that we have um as far as land mass is concerned and of course,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:44:49,there have to be more offices in that District so that is the way we're going to be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:44:55,um deploying those new recruits who we have to send out into the district but it's going to be based on um where the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:02,crime is going on and because the 7th District is a hot spot and it's um there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:08,are a lot of areas out there that we um have to address and it's a large District we're going to be putting most,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:14,of our um our new recruits in those areas we're going to put them where we need them in Seventh District is an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:20,example of probably where a good number of those recruits will be okay um and I want to just highlight,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:27,something for my colleagues and I know you're aware of this I was uh in a meeting in the sixth district,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:33,um with the D.A DA's office uh Captain Gillard some of his folks there was no,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:38,AC it was hot yes and I immediately went to property management and said what are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:43,you doing about the AC here and you know Supply chains blah blah blah but the conditions in various uh buildings are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:51,not what they should be um and as we're talking about retaining uh police officers retaining civilians,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:57,we need to make sure as a city that we're taking care of the building the physical infrastructure in which you all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:46:03,need to work and so again I will press Property Management as much as I can to make sure that the AC is working in the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:46:10,sixth district I was talking to Commander Nolan in the second district the streets around the police,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:46:23,they're bottoming out on the streets and so we did a ride along with the sewer and water boards to try to take care of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:46:29,some of those bigger potholes but again I think as a city we need to make sure,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:46:34,that the areas around the stations the stations themselves need to be the best,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:46:39,that they can be so that you all can do the jobs that you need to do and not be hindered by the physical aspects of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:46:46,headquarters and streets around you so I just want to give you a heads up and and really thank your folks for bearing with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:49:38,I want to ask about these civilian hires is there any any thought about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:49:45,with no uh maybe maybe too late now but with the recent high school graduates getting some of those kids 18 19 year,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:49:53,olds 17 year olds were finished in high school get them in the nopd pipeline of civilians and in two to three years,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:00,whenever they're ready for the Academy they have experience and knowledge of how nopd operates that's our thought,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:07,with the police cadet uh program you know they um through that program of course they're doing a lot of clerical,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:15,things you know assisting in different office in different offices and different units,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:20,um not actually doing any uh active police work or anything like that but learning um what we do and hopefully,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:27,um through the cadet program they'll see whether they want to go to the civilian side I actually become um a police,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:34,recruit so that's our hope that that program is gonna um you know go under,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:39,some police recruits and also some civilian hires through through it and right now we are we we've asked some of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:46,the candidates that actually graduated from the junior Citizens Academy because they're right at that age getting ready,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:53,to graduate from high school the um salary is pretty good for someone who's just you know graduating from high,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:59,school so hopefully um with the salary and the experience and the possibility of uh starting a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:51:06,career at a very young age um we'll go on a lot of participants and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:51:11,hopefully get civilian hires as well as recruit hires well if I could just make that suggestion in uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:52:36,this is a pet peeve of mine I've seen it more and more often and just becoming more Brazen in the city,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:52:43,um the lack of license plates yes in the city whether it's no license place at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:52:48,all no license plate at all and an expired temp tag,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:52:53,um is is one of those two and I see them multiple times a day along with uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:53:02,illegally illegal tents so it's like a combination like I got this legal tenant vehicle with no license plate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:53:09,so to me that's just red flags of something is a is a foot with this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:53:15,vehicle um and it usually maybe a Kia or a uh a Hyundai so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:54:04,Highway enforcement so um this summer so Highway enforcement means stopping those vehicles that have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:54:34,stops that are actually arrests and also I have tasked the district captains,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:54:40,um and their officers and I'm more robust um meaningful uh traffic enforcement in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:55:20,numbers back up as far as manpower to increase the numbers in our traffic,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:55:25,um section in our Traffic Division to make that uh to have that more robust uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:55:42,that's also ways to actually apprehend some of those people who are wanting for violent crimes and attract through the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:55:48,traffic stops so yes we do have efforts in place there have been options on what,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:55:54,to do as far as traffic enforcement is concerned in the districts on the highways we also have overtime that um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:56:01,as we worked on the highways where they're strategically placed in different areas along the interstate and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:56:08,if they see those violations that is a part of the overtime to make those stops,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:56:14,to do that traffic enforcement so we can um get those people who are violating uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:56:20,with the no license plates the expired license plates on the dark tent what have you um and so yes we are uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:57:03,to be a lot of traffic the increase in traffic um coming to and from Bell Chase through Alger is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:57:11,on the goal and and those out of out of town or out of Parish residents show,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:57:17,little respect to our highways especially on the gulf so if we can just pay attention to that area,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:57:24,um how long to go as you get closer to the Woodland Bridge getting closer to Clackamas Parish just to make sure that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:57:30,instead of measures to those individuals like you just can't use Algiers and into,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:57:36,Gall as your your Raceway to get to and from work or to and from school so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:57:49,enforcement in that area I agree and you know we I have also um instructed the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:57:54,district practice to look at where they're having the most accidents in their District we look at the data and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:00:14,are assigned they're more accountable and that's why it's such a fat the pace is moving I'm so much faster than it was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:00:21,and that's why I wanted to put new leadership there because it's about accountability and like I said from the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:00:27,very beginning we have to put people in places where they're strong suit is and I think that um Lieutenant power is very,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:00:51,have um those numbers we have done more than um what was uh done last year it was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:01:39,news story that I hope will be jumped on just as it's been jumped on for years that we were losing so many offices now,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:01:45,it looks like during the first trimester of this year we've cut those number of resignations in half could you talk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:01:51,about that absolutely you know I think um the uh Administration as a whole,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:01:57,um had the foresight to listen to um officers and uh what their complaints,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:02:03,were and why they were leaving a job or leaving the profession and looking over,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:02:09,uh their uh the forms that they have fulfilled their exit interviews to see why uh people were leaving and the mayor,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:02:17,going out um to roll calls and you know listening to the officers and and answering their call you know promises,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:02:23,made Promises Kept um equipment vehicles um computers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:02:28,um better working um conditions as far as stations are a concerned as a council member Harris,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:02:40,promises with um the support of the council um in the the mayor's Administration and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:02:47,so I think the promises made by myself you know I'm looking at different things as far as a disciplinary Matrix um just,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:02:55,different a whole lot of different things that we promised that the officers asked us about we made good on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:03:01,those promises and so people are seeing the change they're seeing um the department as what being more,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:03:08,fair as it comes to pip and disciplinary investigations of that sort so I think people are seeing the change there have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:29:16,yes sir we have one comment from Val Cupid it says please ask uh cheap woodwork if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:29:25,she has ordered or endorsed endorsed the communications division not to make it a priority on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:29:32,suspicious persons call for service if the caller sees no weapon does she endorse trying to prevent crimes from,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:29:39,happening by engaging the public into see something say something for example the soon-to-be murderer parked a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:29:46,distance away from obviously where he wanted to be and walk towards mandina's restaurant if a citizen would have seen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:29:53,the suspicious activity and called it in maybe that murder would not have happened all criminals are suspicious up,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:29:59,to the point where they commit the crime my area was told by a communications director Morris he had on he had an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:06,order from nopd even when police officers are available the superintendent does not want to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:11,prioritize suspicious person calls if the caller sees no weapon Mr Morris,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:17,further stated it was unconstitutional did the Chief order this order this of communications,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:25,that was a lot um and then councilman Memorial go ahead,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:32,um I think it's important I was talking to some individuals the other day with nlpd and they were telling me that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:38,the 911 district has their own mechanism for downgrading calls is that correct,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:44,like they have their own different call identifiers and nopd does I'm not sure if it uh if it's different,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:51,or I think there was some discussion on uh actually um let me refer to the question because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:57,now I understand I just remember the exact context so I was talking to our data analyst and we were trying to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:03,reconcile some of our notes and our reporting that we had previously that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:08,was nopd data and at that time Mr Morris was at the table saying well my data is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:14,completely different and when Jeff was interacting with nopd the reason why,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:22,Mr Morris's information was different was internally they were classifying,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:27,calls differently than the traditional way nopd has done it all right and I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:33,guess my concern is if their job is to work with you guys to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:39,figure out how to prioritize and send calls why are they operating on a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:44,different system and identifiers than what you guys use there was some prioritizing prior to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:52,um my appointment and we just myself and director Morris just recently had a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:58,discussion about um what the the actual online um person the question they asked about about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:32:03,prioritization of a suspicious person and so um he informed me that the previous,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:32:10,administration wanted it on a priority one instead of a a high priority called,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:32:17,or so we have been in discussions about what how we're going to make um certain,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:32:22,costs a priority because just like uh the person who asked a question online said um if it's you know a suspicious,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:32:29,person you know there are certain um criteria I think that they have to meet in order for them to make it on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:32:36,um a two or one so we are in discussions about that because some of uh the um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:32:43,the levels that they had certain calls that didn't agree with I'm like why is that a one or um why you know why is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:32:50,that uh why is that not a more so we're gonna discuss it because those decisions were made prior to my appointment but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:32:56,because they did come up those areas did come up where someone had called in a suspicious person and they put it as a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:33:03,low priority it was a problem so we are in discussions about um where priorities should be with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:33:09,certain calls well I think it's important because I mean to that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:33:14,commenter's point we do not want to create an environment we would prefer to have an nopd officer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:33:22,or an official interact with someone suspected of being a suspicious person rather than a regular citizen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:33:29,potentially armed decide they want to interact with someone that could be auspicious person because whereas a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:33:37,professional is trained in de-escalation and figuring out how to resolve the issue if a normal everyday person,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:33:45,interacts with someone in an aggressive way there's no telling how that person will react you have two law-abiding,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:33:52,citizens who one shows up with a gun accusing them to be a a suspicious person that person's also lawfully armed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:33:59,and goes hell no I'm not and get that gun out my face and suddenly you've got a very different incident all right so I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:05,appreciate y'all looking into that I know that you worked with me previously on some stuff going on with some of our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:10,businesses that were getting harassed but I think it would be very helpful to us for you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:16,to really take the reins in dealing with the 9-1-1 District to really establish clear lines of communication and coding,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:23,because if we're all going to try and track data in particular it's good for all of us to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:28,have matching data and identifiers rather than there be a separate identification system with how they're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:34,classifying things because then we have to have these weird conversations where we're trying to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:40,address sets of data where two people have identifiers and that are completely different so I appreciate you stepping,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:46,in and working on that yes we um it's a work in progress and you know of course every call is different and every scene,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:52,is different so those are the um you know that's the nuances that we have to go over to make sure we're making and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:59,putting the right priority on the right call so we are um in discussions about it and I know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:35:04,um uh director Morris tries to use best practices that are across the country but sometimes that may not fit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:35:10,um for us so we're in our discussion uh with him about where priorities are on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:35:16,on certain calls thank you thank you Chief very much we appreciate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:37:59,that exist to deliver stronger cases uh than we've seen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:05,um in recent history and it's making a big difference it's making a big difference in uh the conviction rate uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:52:48,child and DCFS did nothing they sent her back,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:53:02,the next five years but we owe an obligation to the young people in the City of New Orleans to spend dollars men,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:53:08,and woman hours to get violence away from our young people so they do not become accustomed to it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:53:17,um I would also State and this Council needs to know that DCFS after charges,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:53:45,victims of the abuse just one child was so there's a lot that I think uh this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:53:51,Council needs to be aware of because I think you all can weigh in uh in this space so that we do not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:53:59,um so we not send a message to young people that when they report abuse uh to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:54:05,adults whether they be the beautiful angels at Children's Hospital Children's Hospital or the the beautiful angels who,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:54:14,at nopd who handle child abuse cases that if nothing happens,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:54:21,from a larger level then these children are going to believe that they stepped up and they were,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:54:27,honest for nothing uh and they will grow to become accustomed uh to that type of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:11:01,um that issue Still Remains unresolved uh so we have access and victims and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:11:09,Witnesses have access from 9 to 12 uh based upon uh Sheriff Hudson's ability,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:11:16,to handle that portion what was worked out between the opda and the and the courts was that we would staff that with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:11:24,opda Personnel from 12 on because our work doesn't end at 12. uh we can't try,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:11:31,these cases and be done with it by 12 o'clock uh and we still we're still waiting on that Mo use it's going to be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:11:37,very candid about the status uh of that there was some discussion about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:11:45,electronic monitoring uh there's been a conversation about electronic monitoring with juvenile court uh and there was a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:11:53,conversation with electronic monitoring between uh this group and adult Court,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:12:01,um electronic monitoring is clearly a problem um but it should be a solution,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:12:09,um I Heard the juvenile courts I believe I wrote this down,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:12:14,um uh in response to accounts to committee,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:12:19,chairs uh requests uh to the court,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:12:27,what a kid is doing on a monitor is completely and totally out of their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:12:33,control that's a problem the court is a person that is imposing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:12:39,the condition of electronic monitoring if what they are doing while they are on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:12:45,electronic monitoring is not being monitored than it is out of their control it's not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:12:52,electronic it's a bracelet uh that that has the the the the efficacy and import,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:12:58,of of of of of of of a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:13:04,of of a child's beaded bracelet if it is not being monitored and if they are not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:13:10,robust protocols um and so if in fact that is true and if in fact I am I've heard that correctly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:13:17,uh then electronic monitoring should be immediately suspended in juvenile court,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:13:22,uh because it is not fair uh to the nopd it is not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:13:28,fair to the DA's office uh for judges to release uh uh folks who have were,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:13:36,engaging in repeat offenses to suggest that they're being monitored,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:13:41,when they are not being monitored um I believe the rest of that statement,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:13:47,was um uh it works let me find this line only a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:13:57,small percentage or only a percentage of the young people that are being,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:02,monitored are out of compliance well 25 percent of a hundred can wreak a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:10,whole lot of havoc in a whole lot of neighborhoods uh and as this Council brings up a lot,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:16,it's not all of our kids that are committing these crimes it's a very small percentage and if a judge deems it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:23,worthy and necessary to release a juvenile offender over the objection of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:30,prosecutors and they put them on an electronic monitor then they need to be receiving daily weekly reports about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:38,where this young person is going and so I understand that uh that that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:45,that they may not be able to immediately uh send out uh nopd or share to make an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:52,arrest but when that young person comes back to court for status hearing a motion hearing what have you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:58,we should be reading the compliance record or non-compliance record of this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:04,person and if they are not compliant then they should be remanded and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:09,immediately put back in jail because they they they they have they are they they're in violation of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:15,terms and conditions and Orders of the court and so uh we would submit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:22,uh and and I would even encourage um uh this Council uh I heard a request,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:29,I mean there was one iteration where this was hosted by the nopd electronic margins another iteration uh years ago,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:36,where it was hosted by the Sheriff's Department the sheriff's department and the nopd have already made it very clear that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:44,their woman power Manpower shortages so adding one new thing uh that is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:49,currently being done by private companies um I I don't think is is particularly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:55,prudent especially when these private companies are compiling reports and can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:01,tell a judge and can tell a prosecutor whether or not someone is going from,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:06,home to work or home to school if Keith Lampkin is going to school in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:13,Gentilly and he lives in New Orleans East but was caught breaking into cars,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:18,in Lakeview or Uptown when when that little dot shows him Uptown or shows him,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:24,in Lakeview he is not compliant and a judge should demand that he comes back to court,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:30,and if he has violated the terms and conditions then that Bond should be revoked and he should be remanded that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:36,same policy that same protocol should exist in Criminal Court that report should be read into the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:44,record and if a person is not in compliance if they're somewhere they should not be if they are at their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:50,Ex-Wives home and there was a domestic violence incident then they are violating that stay away order they're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:57,violating the terms of their condition and the electronic monitor is proof of that new crime and and so what I am,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:17:04,asking uh and and I think this council is is poised to do is we can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:17:10,legislatively create uniform permitting uh in order for electronic modern,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:17:16,companies to operate locally and if they are not willing to abide by certain,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:17:22,rules and conditions then they cannot operate in the in the Parish of Orleans not to cut you off but I think you know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:17:29,we don't need tracking and you said it consistently we need,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:17:34,monitoring I don't need anybody to tell me Well Oliver's he's moving from the carjacking now to the armed robbery oh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:17:42,no now he's moving to the shooting on the interstate oh no now he's on his way yes he's on his way uh to the French,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:17:49,Quarter and if he can't do that that serves no purpose exactly right at all it's exactly it is literally observing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:17:57,the problem that's happening right I can tell you where I can tell you every spot he's been where he's committed a crime,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:18:02,while uh having on an ankle mileage that's useless you understand perfectly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:18:08,uh Mr chair and to that end I would submit that we need to agree to uniform,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:18:14,protocols the courts uh the DA's office nopd and it can be housed those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:18:20,protocols can be housed and created by this Council um so that it's very clear that this is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:18:26,a public safety uh necessity uh and I would and I would submit that these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:18:31,reports should not just go go to the court they should come to the DA's office and they should also go to the nopd because when you hear these news,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:18:38,stories and councilman green I've heard you bring this up someone committing a carjack and committing a crime while,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:18:44,they're on electronic monitoring if that information was being delivered to the nopd in real time they would know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:18:50,exactly what this offender was and that information can be used by prosecutors in court to make new cases so these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:18:58,Protocols are necessary they need to be made public uh they need to be uniform for every single section of court,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:19:05,whether it is adult or whether it is juvenile uh it needs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:19:10,that real-time monitoring option that the chair just described and we need expanded regular reporting to all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:19:18,impacted Public Safety agencies so we can use this tool the way uh that it was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:19:23,initially designed and to be even more granular uh even more granular on this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:19:32,um if a person is on probation and there are certain violations of that probation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:19:38,and and and I know uh Council uh accounts president Morrell is steeped in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:19:45,this person that has a technical violation for probation or parole then they are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:19:51,revoked because those rules were explained and there was an agreement,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:19:56,before the person was released and I think we need to embed the same sort of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:20:02,revocation and remand protocols to electronic monitoring because then we can get our hands around the idea of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:20:09,repeat offenders whether it be violent cases or not and if someone has repeatedly committed crime and and a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:20:17,judge says they deserve one more chance on electronic monitoring of our objection there should be immediate and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:20:23,clear revocation rules uh that that are that are put in place I think we can put,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:20:28,these protocols in place in less than a week's time and I think we need to have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:20:34,all criminal justice stakeholders on board with that and with that I would turn it over uh to uh to the to the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:20:41,chair no thank you I I think everything we've heard here today say this needs to be uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:20:48,some sexual auto business and operation when you talk about this particular industry I think the judges also said,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:20:54,how can the judges be involved in in issuing a sentence or a judgment on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:20:59,someone and not have any of their recommendations attached uh to this monitoring system so I think it's clear,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:21:05,whatever has to happen if it has to go through this committee or the criminal justice coordinating Council whatever we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:21:10,we need to do we need to come up with some Central standards and Central operating procedures about this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:21:15,participate if it's going to be part of the Criminal Justice System it needs to work for criminal justice Mr chair I'll,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:21:20,be willing to uh uh offer and present to you a set of standard protocols and if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:21:27,any of the other agency actors have issues with them I I would I would love to publicly vet those with you because I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:21:34,believe this is a crisis situation in terms of repeat offenders let's do that let's clear our calendars to do that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:21:40,something we can present to develop to the industry yes sir and the other partners I've spoken to the private,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:21:47,Industries and they are on board with uniform protocols because there are some that do it well and some that do it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:21:52,poorly thank you any other councilmember green,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:21:59,um D.A Williams I have a very specific question relative to the monitoring,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:22:04,the companies that you've talked to have suggested that there is a way to Monitor and track the movements of as many,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:22:12,people as we might have on ankle monitors at a time that's the challenge that I see that how many of you think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:22:18,might be on a ankle monitor at a time and are you imagining that someone is at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:22:23,a computer station where they're watching the movement if it's possible I'd love it to happen but um I think I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:22:29,think that is as as described by the agencies that have been uh up here before I think it is it is from a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:22:36,Manpower woman power issue for nopd in the sheriff's department I think that is close to an impossibility because we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:22:42,want those folks on the street in in the jail and in courts uh but these private companies uh it's scalable uh they uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:22:51,many of the companies have said they can they can manage that and can report uh issue reports to the courts juvenile,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:22:57,adult and issue reports to nopd and issue reports to the district attorney's office I believe that Chief godan uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:23:04,who's been able to join us we just got back from the judicial armbank at two and brought has an idea uh with regards,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:23:12,to how this can be coordinated with a real-time cameras and would you weigh in with for the councilmember green sure uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:23:18,so one of the functions that I got to do is overseeing the district screening initiative was take a tour and meet some,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:23:24,of the Fantastic Personnel at the real time Prime Center and if what we're asking uh are hopefully modern and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:23:31,robust ankle monitoring system to do is to be a repository and live wire for the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:23:36,monitoring of potentially violent individuals so we have concerns about we're concerned about their location and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:23:42,we're concerned about what their activities are while they're under this period of monitoring if there was only,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:23:48,an organization set up to monitor with Savvy Electronics capability a live wire electronic information flowing in on a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:23:55,constant basis you need to have travel no further than the real-time crime center to see the wonderful Personnel,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:24:00,they have on board now I'm I'm sure I can't uh promise their resources or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:24:06,promise or capabilities but I was extremely impressed with what they're doing already and if we were to try to take advantage of already existing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:24:13,infrastructure of already existing training regimes and have already existing competence,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:24:19,in this field and it might be not too hard of a search calcium green is doable,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:24:25,it is absolutely doable um and it's doable without adding an excess burden to the uh men and women of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:24:32,the New Orleans Police Department or the Sheriff's Department one thing that the criminal the criminal District,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:24:38,um judges said was that it's not really the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:24:44,violent criminals who are on the ankle monitors that it shouldn't be those are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:24:49,the ones right well well until they're violent right so what what do you imagine for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:24:56,example the real-time crime Center let's say there were 200 people on ankle,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:25:02,monitors because of the juvenile courts or whatever it might be you envision maybe a way to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:25:09,is it it is still got to be does it still have to be reactionary or are you suggesting that there's something that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:25:14,you can do that you can identify if someone is out of their Lane whatever the requirements were well so what's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:25:21,going on with respect to a first appearance and a uh commissioner putting Bond restrictions,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:25:27,in place that could be satisfied through the monitoring from the ankle monitor itself is saying you're only allowed to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:25:33,be at this location during these hours you're only allowed to be at your work location during these hours and you're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:25:38,prohibited from going anywhere near a third location at all times right and so that's really just geopensing drawing a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:25:45,line on a map with the radius around it and saying if this ankle monitor which is reporting live GPS data enters into,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:25:51,one of these zones we can immediately set up a notification procedure and notify appropriate authorities if we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:25:57,think it's an emergency situation or the very least notify interested parties like the judges like the DA's office who,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:26:03,are overseeing these individuals and we can act appropriately so I don't think that there is a big uh intellectual or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:26:10,logistical hurdle to setting up that kind of a monitoring system if you want to have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:26:15,a efficient and a competent group run this program you've got to search for people who understand the technology and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:26:22,co-administer it appropriately I think your ability to set up a set of parameters that are Universal across,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:26:28,this board with input from all the stakeholders stakeholders gives you an opportunity to have a finger on the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:26:33,scale for how tight this program is going to be run and what kind of response we expect from our law,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:26:39,enforcement Partners I mean if I could celebrate and invoke councilmember jeruso uh here this is not an either or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:26:46,this is a yes and right because if it is at real-time camera Center uh Ross over,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:26:52,there who does an amazing job and was instrumental in us uh getting a conviction for that case uh out of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:26:58,little woods they can ping,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:27:04,nopd in real time if an individual who committed car burglars let's say on a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:27:12,certain Street if they're back in that area they can let the nopd know in real,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:27:17,time they can also send reports of non-compliance to judges that would,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:27:23,allow them when the person comes back for a motion hearing or status hearing say well look let's let me look at councilmember Green's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:27:30,comings and goings over the past month well councilman green you would not you were supposed to be at home in Gentilly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:27:37,or at school in New Orleans East why does this have you uh up in uptown New,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:27:43,Orleans after curfew hours right I'm gonna remand you because you were told,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:27:49,where the two places the two areas you needed to be and you were out there I don't know whether or not you broke the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:27:55,law but you broke my order and so now that's being revoked so we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:28:01,can have that that sort of real-time reactionary proactive measure and we can also have the reactive measure for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:28:07,non-compliance and I think it can really drill down on the repeat offenders in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:28:13,our community uh that that are having us sitting on broken pieces of glass uh and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:28:18,our seats in the morning right I just want to make it clear to all of you all that I personally uh it's up to all the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:28:24,council members but it would be very strongly supportive of a centralized program that used the technology like,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:28:30,that because of course that's what we hear from the public all the time what do you mean you know you didn't know I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:28:36,mean you couldn't find out even after the fact sometimes um but the bottom line is is that you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:28:41,know I would imagine that the technology does exist and it can be used and yes we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:28:46,have a real-time crime Center I mean crime camera Center that really should be utilized in that respect but the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:28:52,ability to Ping an officer and say that someone who was not supposed to be east of Esplanade now Esplanade east of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:28:59,Esplanade go in we've got to watch my words go and see about him that's a good idea I think so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:29:06,too thank you councilmember very strongly supportive thank you councilmember Harris a quick question about space since I am,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:29:14,kind of obsessed by space I know we my office District the office tried to get you connected with the Keller Center,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:29:21,um to use to house uh your Adas in the field because the calories that our husband sitting empty and unused since,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:29:29,uh hurricane Ida and we've been trying to get some programming in there unfortunately the mayor has decided that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:29:35,it's going to be used for something else so I'm wondering if there's any other space that you all have identified,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:29:41,um in any of our districts that we can try to broker some deal with the administration to get y'all in to make,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:29:47,sure that you have programs in community and outside of normal business hours I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:29:53,will say I mean we're open to any and all uh suggestions we were not looking,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:29:59,for high-end areas let me be clear we were looking for areas where there is a lot,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:30:04,of crime whether it's violent whether it is car break-ins what have you to bring,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:30:10,law enforcement a regular presence to that area that's why we ping uh that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:30:16,Central City area because it has been a an area where there have been a number of crimes and we thought the presence of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:30:22,DA's going there every morning working there till late in the evening working on weekends would help reduce uh crime,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:30:31,in that area by adding law enforcement eyes and ears uh we're open to any any any part of the community we'd rather,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:30:36,not be um in an area where there's no crime because we think we can sort of kill two,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:30:42,birds with one stone just by the mere presence yeah now listen that center to me was ideal because it also has,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:30:49,basketball courts can that can be used for youth programming I know the last time you were here about the play,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:30:54,program where you could literally have kids come in and play interact positively with your staff maybe Shadow,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:31:02,you um as young Malachi did um and so again I think it's a shame that our plans for the Keller Center,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:31:09,were interrupted by the administration but it is what it is they ultimately have to say on what goes where with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:31:15,their property um I will continue to look and I promise you to continue to look in District B,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:31:22,um for property that might house y'all and I also encourage you to work with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:31:27,the school board because I know they also have some properties that are abandoned and I'll connect you with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:31:32,Katie who is Katie beaudwin who's the head of their property I also just want to thank uh Mr Dedenne about the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:31:40,embedded uh DA's I think it's going to be so positive for a community Keith,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:31:47,thank you the other day for hanging out with me and and Captain Gillard and moving forward with identifying problem,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:31:52,businesses and eradicating flight you know I I just can't thank you enough,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:31:58,Jason you're a friend a mentor um and I appreciate that but I do appreciate the work that you're doing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:32:04,especially on the ankle monitoring Keith was there when Captain Gillard said that they uh apprehended someone a young,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:32:11,person whose monitor had been off for six days and nobody had flagged that and the kid,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:32:19,went on to commit additional crimes while he was working had the monitor on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:32:25,his leg but because it was not working nobody could tell where this kid was and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:32:31,and the kid allegedly committed additional crimes so again along with council member green I think that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:32:37,would be receptive of trying to figure out maybe we can all just sit together,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:32:43,um to try to figure out how we can Implement a force multipliers you like to say with electronic monitoring that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:32:50,can really help assist in what we're seeing here in the community so again thank you I you know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:32:56,whatever we can do thank you councilmember uh there have been no other comments,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:33:01,from other customers first of all thank you uh one of the things that I appreciate I've talked uh after some,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:33:09,study and interviewing criminologists on the good morning show the last couple years I mentioned when I got this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:33:16,position again was the law of crime concentration uh noted criminologist Dr wiesman talks about how we focus on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:33:23,communities you mentioned uh reclaiming communities and the word you know to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:33:30,reclaim a Reclamation means the uh process of claiming something back I uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:33:36,I like the idea of what you did in the quarter and what you did in New Orleans,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:33:42,East uh residents don't have to be involved they don't if they don't want to be but just the idea of having a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:33:49,press conference about an arrest uh someone who was fingered for a violent crime in the community does something to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:33:56,the confidence of that neighborhood and it also said something to the other criminal element Opera that if we could,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:34:03,get him or her out of your neighborhood guess what we're coming to get you how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:34:08,much more of that will we see and and how much more will we coordinate that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:34:15,because I think that's part of a great Reclamation effort as well as the own,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:34:20,art of crime concentration which identifies those hot spots where criminals have operated over the last 20,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:34:27,or 30 years uh council member uh you hit the nail in the head uh Chief godan's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:34:32,idea about uh having that sort of District uh specific,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:34:39,city-wide commitment uh at the intake in terms of when when those arrests are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:34:46,made that's exactly what we're talking about but we're going to be doubling down on those efforts on the back end so that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:34:53,you know sometimes the news covers an arrest but they don't cover that conviction right and the communities and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:34:59,I've heard it overwhelmingly even it was really loud uh from residents and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:35:24,it clear that we're claiming it back and we're not going anywhere and and the the folks that wish to wreak havoc that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:35:31,small minority we're going to marginalize them marginalize them all the way into,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:49:30,behavior in the jail number one is knowing when they're going to get out number two is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:49:37,um making sure they can stay in touch with their families number three is food and then,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:50:29,um we have lived experience peer supporters those are from Metropolitan uh Human,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:50:35,Services District they have group sessions with our residents just because they've been there before they're able,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:50:45,issues that we're having Dr bergdon initiated us having eight case managers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:50:51,and how many did we have when you first came into going to begin with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:50:56,and so we now have case managers to um uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:51:02,develop a case management system we have we hired our manager over them yet and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:51:07,uh well we're still working on getting our manager over all of them but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:51:13,um yes so uh one of the things that I was faced with when I was arriving uh was the number of Grievances and so I've,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:51:20,tried to work out a strategy to meet people's requests and grievances so one of those things we've done is had a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:51:26,40-hour certificate mediation program uh delivered so we're just starting to do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:51:32,that now so we've already had two residents asked to have mediation about complaints against staff and the staff,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:51:38,have agreed it's a voluntary process and we've also got two groups of Staff who,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:51:43,wanted mediation which we didn't expect that would be the case so we got together with HR they'll observe the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:51:49,process and pick it up from there if it's required um so we're hoping that that be one way to reduce the Grievances and the lift,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:51:57,experience guys are there to mediate between residents so if there's issues,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:52:02,between residents right which could drive violence in the jail so that that's huge for us,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:52:08,um and people want to be heard which is another thing that dry us Behavior so just making sure that we work on that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:52:14,grievances have been down we want it to continue to go down and we want to make,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:52:20,sure that we deal with issues one-on-one and listening to folks so that's a huge,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:52:25,a huge win for us um you see the use of forces down that's big for us because of the injuries that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:52:32,that cause causes both to Residents but especially to our Workforce which is already depleted we've had people with a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:52:40,number of injuries whether it's uh knees Achilles all kinds of things so bringing down that use of force is important and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:56:04,about in the past um you can see some resigned for personal reasons is the biggest driver,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:56:09,and then the next would be um we had people terminated around 15 folks,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:56:15,terminated for a misconduct or misconduct or performance of some type not a great deal of retirement and of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:56:59,our jail management case manager and grievance tablet and commissary system all these are very essential to daily,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:57:05,life at the jail we are um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:57:11,the general management system which drives almost all of the data in the entire criminal justice system as we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:57:17,have mentioned many times is 40 plus years old and is on its last leg so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:57:22,we're really looking forward to uh moving forward on that there are going to be some meetings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:57:28,coming up about that I believe in the next couple of weeks and we have invited,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:57:34,um Nathaniel Weaver from the city caos is what have been working on the whole uh Criminal Justice System uh funding,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:57:42,with the arpa funds is going to be a part of that but we need updated case management system this is huge when I was the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:57:50,police monitor if I wanted to see an investigation at nopd all I had to do is a couple of clicks of this in my,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:57:55,computer and I could see it I could see the evidence the recordings everything we do not have that in our system it is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:58:01,very difficult to manage and to supervise investigations without assist case management system that is essential,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:58:10,and then residence grievance commissary and tablets those are huge grievances everybody doesn't want to be upfront,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:58:16,about filing a grievance sometimes they need to do that secretively and the tablets can help us to do that and then,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:58:21,the commissary I I said something to do but commissary is a close uh it's a very,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:58:27,high priority for those in custody and making sure that they can get to access things that they would like to get so uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:58:34,that's that's something that also helps to drive Behavior so we're in the process for all of these uh trying to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:58:40,bring these new systems online they're huge for us um and uh we're looking forward to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:58:47,finalizing those as you can see here's the status we accepted proposals until the 18th um I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:58:53,talked about Nathaniel Weaver being on board and these are the number of proposals that we've received uh and we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:59:00,will be having demonstrations from them uh next week on May 16th,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:59:07,okay we're gonna switch a little bit to population um as of 5-2 we are at a little over a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:59:12,thousand um we would love to be in the 800 or less range,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:59:17,um as you can see repeat uh people have been repeatedly arrested is a majority,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:59:23,of the population a vast majority and the average number of times that people have previously been booked is up to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:59:29,8.56 I think the last time we were here was in the 8.2 8.3 range,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:59:35,uh you can see our mental health caseload that is a huge issue for us it's a consent decree issue it drives a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:59:41,lot of our Manpower and women power in the jail making sure that we can get them to their medical and Mental Health,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:59:47,appointments is huge and our emergency deployment plan is helping with that but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:59:53,it's going to take hires to to be fully deployed and um I've got to mention,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:00:00,did I mention the Staffing plan where we are um we have some help putting together,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:00:06,our staffing plan some experts on that they've conducted the interviews gone through all the positions uh and we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:00:13,think we'll have uh a report on that in the next month or two it just depends on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:00:18,how quickly they're able to to finish that but we look forward to sharing that with you as soon as that's done,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:00:25,as you can see we um around 70 percent of folks are in our jail for violent,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:00:30,charges or weapons charges the rest are drugs property and other types of crimes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:00:36,and uh the last box talks about doc transfers we transfer as many people as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:00:41,we are able to um but that is a collaboration with Doc and Staffing is down everywhere so we've,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:00:47,worked with them as best we can to get as many people uh off to Doc as we can and they come every two weeks is that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:00:54,right a little bit of information about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:00:59,average length of stay based on race and age and as you can see of course it's younger folks and nominally,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:01:06,African-American um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:01:11,um as you know I was not able to win the day on the millage and in fact,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:01:17,um the resounding defeat so we're gonna continue to prioritize that funding,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:01:22,issue these challenges uh related to complying with the consent judgment uh a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:01:28,lot or about money so we're going to continue to Prior prioritize that we're going to regroup we're going to talk to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:01:34,our bond Council I believe next week and then come back with a game plan on how we're going to bring that back,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:01:41,one of the things though I learned during this process during our community meetings is when I have when I'm there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:01:47,to answer questions and to speak directly to our community they understand what I'm trying to get to and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:01:52,so we will prioritize that and make sure the infrastructure is in place to do that all over the city uh but we're sad,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:02:00,about that councilmember Morrell just just to brief comment on that uh obviously,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:02:06,uh as you said the outcome of the election was not optimal,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:02:12,I will say I've had conversations with other sheriffs across the states I'm sure you have as well in particularly I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:02:17,spoke to some of the individuals in the business community that helped sheriff lapinto with his most recent millage,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:02:23,and they said it took about 18 months of Outreach to community groups to get them,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:02:29,in a position where they could be successful I don't just want to put on your radar passing the increased millage,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:02:36,I am increasingly concerned about the current millage which expires in 2025.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:02:42,and I think that without significant public Outreach to educate people on how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:02:49,the current money is used without Shoring up support for the current money I don't think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:02:56,that the prospective money is alone at being at risk I think the renewal's at risk at this point for the existing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:03:03,money which obviously your office relies upon yeah absolutely wise counsel we will be having all those conversations,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:03:08,again putting the infrastructure in place to blanket the city we have a lot to say and a lot of information to share,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:03:14,and we've got to make sure we do that I have to make sure we do that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:03:20,um so our challenge is related to funding as you know the design elements in the jail there are a couple of things,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:03:26,that we really need to prioritize that is suicide proof sales and we need to prioritize something about the netting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:03:32,to keep people from being able to hurt themselves so we want to talk to you more about that going forward we really,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:03:38,have to prioritize that that's a problem for our team every day uh we talked about it and we're looking,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:03:44,forward to the whole arpa funds process to see what we're going to be able to get we know that the jail management,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:03:50,system has to be changed and so that's huge for us and will help us to be more of a smart jail uh uh and which will you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:03:58,know be make it uh easier for us to do our job and easier for us to prove to the court that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:04:05,we're doing a better job and that we're complying uh there are four aspects of consent judgment policies procedures,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:04:12,training on those policies and procedures supervision to reinforce,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:04:17,those policies and procedures and accountability for making sure that people who violate them are held,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:04:22,accountable but you have to be able to prove all that and this problematic system makes it very difficult for us to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:04:29,be able to do that so it's a huge thing we look forward to working on but we're going to continue to work on the things that we can and that is the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:04:36,training and professional development we have Nic here we're going to take advantage of as much much of that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:04:42,training and help and support as we can get we met with um judge Friedman as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

5:05:02,um we need to continue to replace outdated equipment all over the facility whether it's for our officers or whether,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:05:08,it's for the structures itself those are a huge part of safety in the jail,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:05:14,and then we talked about the mobile command unit that is not just a booking bus that is about operations if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:05:20,everything if an emergency occurs that is the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office functioning outside of this city so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:05:26,that's a huge thing so those are things we'll be prioritizing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:05:31,um we've got this has been a good year on dealing with our community as we've been able to open back up we've been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

5:09:20,[Music] thank you this is somewhat related but not really related,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:09:25,uh my office has received a bunch of calls regarding some blighted property the Sheriff's Office owns uh upon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:09:33,reviewing on the Assessor's website this isn't property that you came into possession of it's property the law,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:09:40,enforcement District just happens to have many of it primarily there's a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:09:45,property on Norman C Francis Parkway that a individual's been complaining,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:09:51,about for her mom and her grandmother and since Katrina so obviously these predate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:09:58,your time but I guess the greater question is it appears that the law enforcement district is sitting on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:10:05,dozens of properties that are not in great shape is there a plan on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:10:13,how to secure or even better obviously with with the challenges your office is facing liquidating the properties,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:10:19,because it would appear from the pictures we've seen of some of these properties it is going to cost you a tremendous,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:10:26,amount of money and maintenance to keep these property up kept in secured especially with the new blight laws yeah,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:10:34,um we um we I just spoke with our director of facilities management this morning and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:10:40,we go by these properties I think twice a month he said to check on them I've gotten two complaints since I've been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:10:46,here one is at a property really close to the jail um and the other one is at a building we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:10:51,had to close because it was in such bad shape and we had to move all of our Investigative Services Bureau out of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:10:56,that building because it was not safe for them to to um be in so those are the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:11:02,two I've got we'll um have a new director of operations coming in that's one of our key hires which,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:11:08,will include buildings managing buildings but we definitely we want to look at what we can do with these to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:11:14,remove them liquidate them there was there was a thought about even perhaps working with community and um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:11:22,habitat from Humanity or others to have housing for folks leaving so we don't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:11:28,want to preclude looking at that but we'll put a game plan together when the new director of operations comes in I I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:11:33,appreciate that and certainly I'll pass these complaints on this one property along to your staff and I think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:11:39,this property is one that can possibly remediate it in the interim to not be uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:11:46,affecting the community as much as it is now but I do have a concern we recently changed the blight law pretty,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:11:52,significantly in properties that do not have water or electricity going into,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:11:58,them are now by de facto blighted so when your new operation person comes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:12:03,online it would be nice to at least be able to articulate a plan with them as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:12:09,to what you're going to do with the property because it certainly if you have if your operations director comes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:12:15,in with a plan on how they're going to deal with it it would put the city in a position that when residents call about these specific properties we can say,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:12:21,well we've seen the plan here's what they're going to do I think it's a tremendous possibility that if you could,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:12:28,use some of this property for transitional housing for people that are coming out as they especially if you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:12:34,curate you know and trans provide transitional housing with Partners like first 72 or the like that would be a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:12:42,fantastic way to use the property but a lot of it is pretty fellow a lot of this I mean some of it's just literally steps,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:12:48,with nothing there so I mean yeah the sooner we can get a plan the better I appreciate it thank you thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

5:15:06,2023 and how it compares to previous years we also wanted an opportunity to be able,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:15:13,to discuss some projects that we've released in the last three months which,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:15:18,includes the secondary employment report how we've monitored the vapi investigation and our involvement with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:15:25,ocdm regarding consent to create compliance,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:15:30,so moving on to a data snapshot of where we are in 2023,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:15:37,starting with use of force and critical incidents use of force and critical incidents are monitored by the office of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:15:44,the independent Police monitor we do on-scene monitoring for anything that constitutes a critical incident and a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:15:51,critical incident would include when there's deadly force and officer-involved shooting if there's a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:15:57,head or neck strike with an impact weapon or if somebody dies in custody,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:02,so 24 hours a day any day of the year if one of these incidents occurs we immediately receive a call from dispatch,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:09,and we go out to the scene and we monitor every aspect of the nopd's investigation specifically the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:15,investigation that's conducted by the force investigation team so in previous years we saw higher,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:23,numbers of critical incidents than we've seen in more recent history and we're happy to report that critical incidents,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:28,are going down each year um we did have a little bit of an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:33,increase in 2019 and 2020 but um those critical incidents may not have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:39,involved any deaths nor may they may not have involved any people we had some,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:45,um negligent discharging of weapons and we also had a higher number of animals,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:52,being shot by the nopd so far in 2023 we've only had a few,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:58,critical incidents this year we've been spending the majority of our time in that department,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:05,monitoring firearm discharges level four uses of force that have been non-critical,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:11,two critical incidents and um and just monitoring Force investigations we've,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:17,attended seven use of force review board meetings where um sorry we have attended,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:24,um I believe five use of course review board meetings where seven uses of forced investigations were revealed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:32,and we always provide assessments um and recommendations during the use of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:38,force review board meetings the office of the independent Police,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:44,monitor is a complaint intake site so we are available to the public and to nopd employees for them to be able to file,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:52,complaints of Officer misconduct so far in 2023 we've received 42,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:59,complaints of Officer misconduct the majority of which have been filed by civilian complainants so people that are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:05,not hired by the nopd at the time of the complaint and then we've received eight,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:11,complaints from Anonymous complainants and that might include people that are associated with the nopd or not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:17,associated with nopd um this is pretty on par with what we've,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:23,seen in previous years as you can see from the last four years we do tend to receive the majority of our complaints,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:30,from civilian complainants and from Anonymous complainants but I will highlight that the information that's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:36,disclosed in a lot of our Anonymous complaints are clearly from individuals,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:41,who are um within the nlpd organization,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:47,we also started a new category called civilian nopd employee to be able to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:53,track complaints that we receive from civilians who are working within the nopd,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:59,the majority of the complaints that we receive we receive via our website we also have received a lot of complaints,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:06,on phone through email through social media and even through the US mail,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:11,what's been going down is the amount of complaints that we receive in person,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:20,whenever there's a formal disciplinary investigation that's investigated by the public Integrity Bureau the oipm is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:27,notified of the disciplinary proceeding and attends the disciplinary hearing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:32,that occurs in 2022 we attended 79 disciplinary,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:38,hearings and that includes Captain panel hearings and superintendent committee hearings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:44,and these um ranged in severity from adherence to law to professionalism,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:51,so far in 2023 we've attended 16 disciplinary proceedings we have noticed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:59,that disciplinary proceedings tend to be um tend to be uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:05,um mostly like a back end um activity in the nopd As in that they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:11,handle the majority of their disciplinary proceedings at the back end of the year um we're trying to encourage them to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:19,um to schedule these throughout the year so that way they are not bombarded with hearings at the end of the year,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:27,and um we've attended a handful of hearings every month so we have been seeing the nlpd put effort into,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:33,scheduling disciplinary hearings as quickly as possible instead of waiting till the end of the year,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:40,so far in 2023 we've held um I believe five mediations,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:49,um and we've received significantly more referrals we're still having a difficult,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:55,time specifically with our civilian participants agreeing to mediation and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:21:02,um we are working with nopd to explore different ways to utilize our community police mediation program to ensure that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:21:10,it's reaching not just the community but the employees that would most benefit from these skills in this opportunity to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:21:16,do active listening and to hone their communication skills,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:21:22,also this year a new initiative is that we're now teaching active listening courses at the nopd Academy we've taught,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:21:30,10 courses so far this year and we teach these classes to off to new officers and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:21:37,to new supervisors as a way to reduce conflict conflict to improve the way that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:21:43,supervisors engage with those that they're managing and hopefully improve their communication and listening with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

5:28:15,is it any consistency in those what's the kind of thread that holds,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:28:20,those together when you can automatically see it's consistent with investigation that had been done before,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:28:27,is there a common practice sir that would ultimately lead to in the type of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:28:32,investigation that you're seeing so we do look for different ways to be able to track any type of pattern or to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:28:40,be able to identify outliers in the misconduct that we're seeing whenever we notice a potential pattern we do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:28:46,communicate with nopd leadership to make them aware of that pattern so they can address it on on a larger scale so they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:28:54,can maybe do a department-wide retraining or that they can do some more focused monitoring on a particular Squad,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:29:02,platoon or District um what we're mostly seeing is that there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:29:09,is dissatisfa dissatisfaction the public is dissatisfied that's what I'm trying,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:29:14,to say the public is dissatisfied um with how nrpd handles issues when,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:29:21,there are not enough officers to go out basically so whenever you hear accounts of there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:29:27,being 14 hour waits in New Orleans East for the nopd to be able to respond to a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:29:32,mental health crisis it's pretty reasonable to assume that the threat is going to be that there's going to be an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:29:38,allegation of misconduct or neglect on the part of the nopd from that member of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:29:43,the public they're going to feel like their emergency wasn't taken seriously,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:29:49,um and that the nopd didn't respond and then those officers who are responding if they're tired if they feel overworked,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:29:57,that's often seen by the public and that might be misconstrued as disrespect,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:30:04,um so we really want to be able to kind of connect to the nopd that when they're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:30:10,when they're performing well misconduct allegations tend to go down,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:30:15,um which one would expect to see and um and when they're engaging with the community and being transparent with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:30:22,community again we see misconduct complaints again go down so we always try to encourage those types of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:30:29,connections to be made otherwise we are looking at any area where our data could,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:30:35,suggest that there's some type of causation between what the nopd is doing and the complaints that we're receiving,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:30:43,um and and we do communicate to nopd that that sometimes the way they're messaging,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:30:49,their actions can um Can undercut uh their goals so you know in the case of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:30:57,um recently there were allegations that the nopd used tear gas on second on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:31:03,Super Sunday and that was an allegation that really um I think shook the community up just,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:31:09,because so many members of the community were communicating to our office and to the nopd that they were very happy with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:31:15,the nopd presence at Super Sunday that they felt that the police were very respectful of the Mardi Gras Indian,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:31:21,Crews we hadn't heard any accounts to suggest otherwise and so we were surprised to hear of this account of um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:31:28,of alleged tier uh alleged um pepper spray I'm sorry did I say tear gas I meant pepper spray yeah and um and then,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:31:35,upon reaching out to nopd leadership and looking into the incident the nopd officers hadn't used any pepper,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:31:42,spray they instead were breaking up a fight that occurred between two civilians during which they used Peppers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:31:48,it was a false allegations it was a false allegation but it was based on misinformation that hit social media and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:31:54,alarmed many people so we just want to make sure that in cases like that that nopd feels empowered to be able to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:32:00,communicate directly with the public and say we know this picture is getting circulated we know this misinformation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:32:06,is out there what can we do to assure you that that was not that's not what occurred but we're also doing our due,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:32:13,diligence we check and verify and we're going to make sure that nopd handled,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:32:18,this situation as best as as appropriate as possible under our policies but I I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:32:24,think that's an opportunity for them to be able to say that um that there that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:32:29,the Public's instincts to believe that nopd was there and sensitive and and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:32:34,engaging appropriately with the community at Super Sunday was correct they were and um and this was some,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:32:41,misinformation that really took social media by storm and that happens,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:32:47,yeah we just want to make sure that nopd is able to um to address those things head on so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:32:53,there isn't misinformation that floats around that officers are out there pepper spring the community during,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:32:59,um very important community events uh and also in your report you said that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:33:05,um certain obstacles that keep misconduct from easily being caught,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:33:13,within the system and it's worded in a way that these certain obstacles is usually pretty consistent,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:33:19,you know what are they and how do we mitigate that especially as you work to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:33:25,move forward with with the work that you're supposed to do right right in the secondary employment system the main,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:33:31,obstacles that we were seeing in the secondary employment system was that the two time keeping systems were not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:33:37,speaking to one another so the office of police secondary employment had one time keeping mechanism and then nopd was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:33:44,using ADP and what we were seeing was that you could be scheduled in both,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:33:49,systems to be in two different places at the same time and then any of those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:33:54,overlaps were then getting fixed and addressed on a time lag so the next week,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:34:00,they would go through those two systems and compare and realize that a mistake had been made and so they would then go,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:34:07,back to see if the officer had submitted a form 93 so it could be more complicit than,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:34:13,Corral exactly exactly it's just making sure that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:34:18,um that individual officers are effectively um checking their time that supervisors,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:34:26,are putting in any changes into their time and that Ops opsc is able to see,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:34:32,what the time is and not wrongfully schedule an officer to be somewhere that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:34:38,would conflict with their shift same with any repeating secondary,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:34:43,employment details that might occur make sure that if those are staying on the schedule that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:34:50,um that then when an officer's an OPD shifts change that is communicated to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:34:56,opsc two more things I'd like to cover uh we hear the chief using the term and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:35:03,she's been lauded for the term by other independent agencies who watch or Monitor and OPD,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:35:09,the term proactive constitutional policing when you hear that what does that mean to you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:35:16,if there's such such a thing uh you agree with it would I I completely there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:35:22,is such a thing proactive policing can be a triggering term just because if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:35:28,it's used in a way to profile or to um an organ discriminatory manner then it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:35:36,going to be inappropriate it's not just going to be against the consent agreeing against nlpd policies but it's going to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:35:42,be against the law and therefore it won't be constitutional and historically that's how a lot of proactive policing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:35:49,was used across the country and now I think coupling the concept of proactive,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:35:55,policing which means preventative actions just being alert noticing the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:36:01,data and then building a police force that's not just responsive to the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:36:06,community but is actually proactively working with the community,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:36:11,to best place themselves to stop crime before it occurs and to support them community so they can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

5:37:17,convect agreements with maybe one or two items still being on the table but with the confidence of the system knowing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:37:23,that even with those two items they thought compliance was headed in the right direction,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:37:29,we heard Chief Ferguson over a year ago uh say that it was given High marks uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:37:36,by the monitors and by the justice department for moving in the right direction have we gone backwards uh are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

5:37:57,we've had to road test a lot of the policies and practices that were created,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:38:02,by the consent decree and we've now what do you mean road test let the public know which yeah what I mean is like I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:38:08,think the secondary employment system is a great example right like that was one of the first areas to reach full and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:38:13,effective compliance under the consent decree and everyone was very happy and they thought that that man's that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:38:19,didn't have to worry about that anymore but um what we then saw was that we built,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:38:26,systems and as they were taken out there and tested so that's what I mean by Road tested like taken out there and and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:38:33,actually implemented and use if this Awards yeah see if it will work we found problems and that meant we had to return,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:38:40,to this area of the consent to cray and and again we look at it and apply new,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

5:38:58,revisiting of areas but I think people think of concentrically compliance as being a very linear path towards,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:39:04,compliance and I asked you the question yeah and I I would love to see that idea of confiance actually be seen more as a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:39:12,spiral that we're going to have to return to certain areas again and again and again but each time from a higher,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

5:53:55,coalition some of the barriers we're seeing is vehicles for our intensive in-home and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:54:00,Community Supervision programs so we have had four vehicles allotted to us um we're waiting for those to arrive,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:54:07,also just technology technology infrastructure prevents real-time documentation to be shared across,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:54:14,departments but we are improving that communication limited applicants,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:54:20,um so we have gotten one new re-entry support specialist but we are looking for two more to increase the capacity of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:54:26,that program um competitive salaries and then city water department competition which Miss,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

5:54:41,our final slide is just um highlighting some of the things that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:54:46,take place so we had Dr Eric Dr Eric Jones that's his name,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:54:53,the speaker Dr uh I think it's Dr Eric Jones that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:54:58,came to the facility um we also had the black men rising and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:55:03,then the picture to um your far right it's just the kids,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:55:08,doing their creative um session um putting their thoughts together for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:55:14,the mural and that this that concludes our presentation and at this time we'll take,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:55:20,questions that was Dr Eric Thomas um you know those times yeah councilmember,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:55:27,Harris yeah I just have um one question and one comment so um what is I've asked this before what,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:55:33,is the capacity total uh youth capacity for jjic 76. have you reached capacity or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:55:41,approach capacity in recent months meaning no we haven't reached capacity,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:55:47,okay so um I think we were trending uh between the 50s and the 60s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:55:53,um some youth were released to our intensive in-home supervision program and then some kids were court order,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:55:59,released okay and I know we've had a lot of uh comment about the ankle monitors,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:56:05,um do y'all have any insight into the use the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:56:11,efficacy so I in all honesty um I'm not happy with the ankle,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:56:17,monitoring program um there was an inter agency meeting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:56:22,um put on by um commissioner um Stevens office,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:56:28,um and where office of Juvenile Justice came to JJ I see the meeting was held at jjicic and to learn,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:56:36,that the monitors are just placed but nobody's really monitoring it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:56:41,pointless um I think the bigger concern for me um in speaking to commissioner um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:56:47,Stevens when she called me about putting a meeting on was the fact that we had six kids former kids of jjicic murdered,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:56:56,in one week and so some of those kids were on ankle monitors,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:57:02,it's heartbreaking it's heartbreaking I think the other piece to it was watching,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:57:09,watching kids come in that were placed on these ankle monitors that no one is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:57:15,monitoring less than 24 hours after their release from jjicic,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:57:20,so council member Thomas I mean it's heartbreaking,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:57:26,because people are worried about being victimized by unmonitored folks but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:57:33,these children can become victims if they're in the wrong place and nobody's watching these monitors to make sure,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:57:40,they are supposed to go where they're supposed to be so that was the biggest thing for me,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:57:45,um and not supporting fingers how can we work together even myself I I don't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:57:52,have the control to place a kid on the monitor um to order a kid but when you uh when,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:58:00,kids are coming to your your space and you you build relationships with these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:58:06,children preservation of Life trumps everything and so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:58:11,um I heard people talk to Dave other agencies talk about you know kids their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:58:18,own monitors whether it's a daughter children and they outre offending but some of those people are being murdered,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:58:24,as well and so that is a lot a lot uh for definitely for me six kids in one,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:58:31,week that was a lots of digest and I like we have to do something,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:58:37,like yesterday yeah tomorrow tomorrow it's too late we have to do something like yesterday yeah and again I hope,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:58:45,that uh the D.A can pull together the courses we're happy we're happy to participate as well I I'm sorry I mean I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:58:52,know that has to be heartbreaking for you all um and I hope that you have you know we talk a lot about Mental,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:58:58,Health Services for our kids but I hope that you all have the services that you need as providers to deal with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:59:05,lost like that that's tough absolutely oh definitely it was a lot for the staff and so whatever resources,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:59:13,um we reached out to the staff and whatever we could do to help them um cope with the loss and that's why it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:59:19,was good that we even for our kids that we have this pilot grief group going on inside the agency because the loss is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:59:27,real I think we we have to over saturate right now we have to over saturate in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:59:33,terms of services for these children if it's duplication is duplication because we have to oversaturate something is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:59:41,whatever we doing not working so we have to over saturate I would rather,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:59:48,sit a kid down then lay a kid down I'm sorry I'm not for mass incarceration,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:59:56,but having them in that space with me I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:00:02,would rather have them in that space with me than to stand at a graveside yeah,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:00:09,yeah I'm sorry no there's nothing to me that's the truth that's the truth and I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:00:14,wish there were more people in this room hearing the truth well councilman thank you for uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:00:20,asking that question uh councilmember Harris some of us have said for quite some time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:00:28,in talking to the people and communicating with them out in the street because you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:00:33,got to talk to them they know what's going on many have said and I've said this in our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:00:41,meetings before using,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:00:46,the system as a turnstile we've we've forgotten about two things,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:00:53,the inability to protect the property and life of the next potential victim,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:01:00,and then would you and Miss Williams know there are people on the outside waiting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:01:08,to murder them as soon as they come out so what I say,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:01:14,to the folk who are pushing for the turnstile,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:01:19,did you pause and think for a minute then maybe if that kid sat down with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:01:25,some intense programming with Mr Goodwin with Ms Williams staff,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:01:31,with the intervention Specialists who operate back there did you think that maybe that time could,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:01:37,help save their life knowing that there are people out there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:01:42,waiting to murder them and I don't I'm just going to say it I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:01:47,don't think a lot of Criminal Justice Advocates are reform Advocates think about it like that right I think they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:01:54,think more about the system than the actual lives and and changing the system,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:01:59,then then the lives of the kids who are being affected and there are far too many of them and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:02:07,we don't want mass incarceration no one we don't want to see our kids locked up but I would much rather go visit them,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:02:14,and talk to them inside a check but and see and have intense programming and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:02:19,maybe let the beef subside send them out there with a different mindset so that they could be alive and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:02:28,free not free to be killed huh so thank you for bringing that up I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:02:34,think this meeting would have gone on without that being said or without that being understood,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqfTCmIlvjw&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
