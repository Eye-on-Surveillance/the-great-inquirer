5:12,this neglect Corps of Engineers the levees breaking but really it was a snapshot of a moment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18,and that was the moment right after Katrina when we were all just like why did this happen when I look when I talked to people who,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:25,have moved here and have so much impatience for why things are the way,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

5:37,Katrina and had to limp and move forward after Katrina,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

5:50,York or from Houston they didn't have a Katrina moment that basically wiped out,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

6:13,who we were as people and we're still struggling with that and I say I wish the people who moved here would see it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:19,because they don't understand they don't understand why the city is in the state it's in they understand why you have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:27,kids who don't have a care in the world for their lives their livelihood their future it's because many of them,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

9:01,we're facing right now and what our young people are facing right now what I hope you don't have to do is come back,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

10:04,do that by watching your film it should be required watching to every citizen of New Orleans who is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
10:11,living in the city right now and who don't understand what's happening in the city because it just puts a point on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

58:49:00,the most important thing in my life and defines everything I do is my role as a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
58:54:00,husband and a parent and I can tell you from the moment I die I met Keith his number one role is being,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:01:00,a father and being a husband and I think that if more people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:06:00,who were in politics in particular would focus on being a good person,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:12:00,being a good husband and being a good father if that was their priority everything else would fall into place,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:18:03,emergency based on the number of shootings that are happening in our city right now based on the fact that I still,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:10,do not see a murder reduction plan coming out of City Hall and being,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:18:35,to raise our families so I'll be brief here because I could speak for a while,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:40,on what the past several years have been like as president but I'll just say this you know when it comes to this Council I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:19:16,think the most important thing we can do is uh is thank you for your turn,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:21,uh you know the public policy part of it in many cases and and I have a little,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:27,experience with it uh is a lot easier than the politics of the people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:32,and uh to do it with grace to do it with you know I think you go overboard trying to be fair,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:38,uh There are rules that govern this body uh there's rules uh that govern the decorum,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:44,and uh as someone who has seen it over the quite a few decades uh the one thing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:51,that you've done is you've tried to give the public their voice uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:57,many times that that voice can be disruptive many times it could even be disrespectful uh but the least you've,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:04,done is try to make sure that this political body uh is people and that's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:10,not easy to do so as someone who's watched it over the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:15,years and then someone who sits here and works with you now uh know that uh your,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:21,toil uh your effort uh and your patience uh even though we don't always agree on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:23:16,that was often unreasonable uh I can say with all Surety she had the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:22,unique ability in the legislature to tackle very controversial issues particularly we worked very closely on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:23:37,be successful in the legislature over issues particular issues where the NRA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:42,was involved by being someone who could work with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:48,very disparate groups of people to get collaborative consensus to move the ball,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:53,forward in my time as a center and as a citizen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:58,and as a council member and she was the president during all three of those periods,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:04,she showed that same level of Grace and collaborative spirit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:09,through all the crises she mentioned because to be clear,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:15,other than Hurricane Katrina which is the definitive crisis of our time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:25:12,as far as being president I honestly don't think it really hit me until this morning I was dropping off my daughter,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:20,at school and she got out the car and said see you later El Presidente,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:25,and I looked at I was like what are you talking about she goes you're the president today,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:30,and I said oh you're right and I guess because our offices work so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:37,closely together I don't really see this as a definitive,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:43,stop and a start to how the council will be operated this Council over the last,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:48,year has been as shown it is an independent Council that is truly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25:55,seeking to restore a balance and parody between the executive and legislative branch of government,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:01,that has not been without conflict but to be clear this Council does not seek,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:06,conflict it simply does not waver from conflict and I think for the public perspective,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:12,from what I've seen in my year in my year here as vice president that is the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:18,leadership the people of the City of New Orleans want they want a council that is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:24,independent of the other branches of government a council that pushes the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:30,envelope on what councils have done in the past and to be frank and candid a council that promotes transparency and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:38,accountability Above All Else and I can say in our year here I've been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:44,very proud to see this Council truly push the envelope on what the council,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:50,can do and continue to push the envelope on what this Council will do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:55,I think it's important to note that under this Council for the first,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:00,time in history there will be a confirmation process for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:06,the incoming Chief of Police I think it's important to underline and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:12,highlight that as a measure we as a council had debate had transparent arguments and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:20,we put on the ballot for the people to consider empowering this Council to have confirmation of marital appointees,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:28,I think what you saw from that vote that happened last fall is that the public has been waiting for the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:35,council to rise to the challenge of being a co-equal branch of government,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:42,and the public rewarded that and gave us that Authority last fall,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:48,I look forward uh both as the president and as the chair of governmental Affairs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:27:53,to having those public meetings regarding the confirmation of the next police chief because the council,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:00,president's point there is a crisis in the city is a crisis that has been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:07,ongoing for several years but has gotten to the point where we as elected officials the public cannot ignore it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:14,I'm also very proud of this Council in particular our leadership from our budget chair council member jeruso,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:21,in that when given a budget last year we did not rubber stamp a budget we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:28,changed the budget substantially we changed the budget in ways to reflect Council priorities in particular when we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:37,did not believe that there were sufficient resources going to those measures that prevent crime versus,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:44,simply funding measures to respond to it this Council doubled the funding for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:49,Nord and this crowd so created additional opportunities for those programs that intervene with our youth,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:56,before they become people who are interacting with our Police Department after the fact,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:04,I'm also very proud contrary to public belief that this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:09,Council has shown it is not a monolith the fact that we have had robust debate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:15,over controversial issues I want to highlight the fact that we had robust difficult debate over issues like,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:23,facial recognition where council members had very dramatic differences of opinion,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:31,and through public debate and public discourse on that issue the council was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:37,forced to compromise on what the ultimate legislation was that's important it's important that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:43,have a public debate and council members can say publicly what their positions,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:48,are and we as a body have that debate in a form where the public can review it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:54,and I do not doubt over this next year we will have more public debate over controversial issues I think of this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:01,Council has shown the days of there being a plethora,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:09,of legislative issues what unanimous approval with no discussion are gone,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:15,as far as my term as president I'll be very short I believe an independent council is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:21,crucial the future of the City of New Orleans I believe the council that stands separately from every other branch is essential to the future of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:28,City of New Orleans and as your president I will continue to push the envelope on what this Council can and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:19:37,notification mailers for this NPP will cover a larger radius than typical NPP,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:20:05,development will remain affordable for 99 years this means that these units,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:23:01,always an afterthought being a part of a project where there is real intentionality where there is a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:07,real commitment to doing things not only the right way but for the right reasons is really effectuating different change,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:41:28,think this resolution that I worked on with a number of my colleagues all of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:33,them um is an expression of intent and part,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:38,of the public record which makes it important it also relates directly to the City of New Orleans,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:44,I first want to say that I wish nothing but the best for interim Chief woodfork,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:50,who I met with yesterday I'm rooting for her and and I look forward to working,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:55,with her I think part of the guiding principles that we're all looking about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:42:00,whether whatever District you're in is looking for whoever is the best to lead nopd,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:42:08,right now that person may very well be here but it may be an outsider too you think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:42:16,about what we're doing with the rank and file police officers we have recruiting campaigns built around not only trying,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:42:23,to get people locally to apply to be a cop but we're also asking others outside of New Orleans too,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:42:30,why should it be any different for the police chief I also think a public process is desired,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:42:36,and healthy it brings Trust we want to ensure public engagement and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:42:43,ensure that leaders are at the table,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:42:48,what should we want in a competitive environment as to think people have seen across the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:43:02,councilmember green is more than willing to point out to us I think looking at salary and other,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:43:09,benefits to ensure that we have the best possible candidate is something that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:43:14,can all and should support so with that I know I have some light,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:43:20,ups here on the machine council president morel,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:43:25,thank you customer jeruso I'll be reviewing a couple of quick points I think that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:43:31,if we are being honest as a council and we are listening to the public sentiment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:43:37,that has been expressed since the announcement of the retirement of the chief there is a consensus across,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:43:45,the entire Community whether it be our community leaders or our business leaders that we have a transparent and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:43:52,thorough National search um I support the work of interim Chief,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:43:57,woodfork and I would further add I think it is a tremendous disservice the chief,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:44:04,would Fork to not have a thorough and transparent National search because in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:44:12,order for us to build the critical mass of support across the entire Community,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:44:17,for chief woodfork I think that it is important that our chief compete,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:44:24,for the job I think that helps her establish herself as the next chief of the nopd if that is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:44:31,her wish furthermore to be candid I appreciate the efforts of councilmember jeruso when,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:44:39,he's talking about the pay of the chief of police there is a national average of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:44:45,What Chiefs are playing across this country and our chief has paid tremendously less than that and I think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:44:52,it's important for us to acknowledge on the front end that if you're going to solicit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:44:57,interest Across the Nation to be the next chief of the City of New Orleans,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:03,that that salary has to at least match what the national average is because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:08,there is no body interested in coming to coach a team that is in crisis if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:15,they're going to have to take a pay cut to do it so I support that measure as well but let me add one last thing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:21,before I pass the mic I will be very candid in saying that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:27,this council did a tremendous amount of work in trying to thread the needle,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:32,between funding and OPD and funding the other different programs and processes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:39,outside of an OPD to prevent individuals from entering the criminal justice,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:44,system versus reacting to it candidly I don't support giving any more money to any group whether it's the nopd,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:51,or the police and Justice foundation without a guarantee and a commitment to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:56,a national search for our next chief I think this Council has been Resolute and repeatedly stating that is our will,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:46:03,that is the will of the public we have dedicated a tremendous amount of resources in this year's budget for uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:46:11,nopd and I personally will not support any additional money going to any group,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:46:16,whether it's a third party or the nopd or any additional resources until this is resolved thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:46:24,thank you uh I'll go to council member Thomas and then come back to councilmember Moreno,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:46:30,councilmember Thomas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:46:36,first of all thank you for the resolution I think the resolution uh supports what uh many of us has have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:46:43,consistently said uh is to share criminal justice uh even though,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:46:49,sometimes we don't know what that means uh but but we're going to figure it out as hopefully as a body at some point,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:46:56,uh we've been consistent in saying that the national search gives us an opportunity,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:47:02,uh to vet and give us the best possible candidate well for me it was it was easy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:47:08,to support that because that's what I know I went through that it was part of that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:47:13,in the past and it yielded uh tremendous results uh six percent reduction in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:47:20,violent crime double the national average murder rate went from 424 to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:47:26,159. but it was also coupled with the stuff that we did as a body uh and funding,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:47:33,youth organizations and the million plus dollars that I'm putting in my district to do Outreach and mentoring in conflict,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:47:40,resolution uh but the other thing that's important is that when we talk about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:47:45,Rob Masson listening to constituencies even though we all have a common,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:51:38,the very uh last paragraph talks about that the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:51:43,council urges and supports increasing the salary of the nopd chief let me,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:51:48,explain why that is important currently the New Orleans police chief makes roughly 180 185 000 a year the head of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:51:59,uh Nola ba makes 265 000 a year the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:52:16,police Chiefs and finding police Chiefs across the country tell me that in New Orleans to be competitive we need to pay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:52:23,roughly 250 to 300 000 a year if you take a look out where Chief Harrison our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:52:29,former Chief went to Baltimore they paid 275 000 a year so I say all of these things because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:53:36,in terms of the police chief is one where it potentially gives the ability,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:53:41,for us to look at some of those factors that could strengthen the work of our new Chief once it's once,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:53:50,the decision is made for example the question of pay for example it's not just a matter of choosing the police,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:54:21,to use this as an opportunity to say something that I said before that the police are but one component of law,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:54:28,enforcement in our city they are the First Responders we see them all the time they have Uniforms on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR53b05t50&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
