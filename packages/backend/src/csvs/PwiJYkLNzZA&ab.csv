1:12,as we visited you all individually in terms of security we are still focused,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18,on and hope that you all remain focused on Courthouse security it's very important there is a need for additional,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:25,deputies a sign from opso in the courthouse as well as in the courtrooms,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31,we're also asking as judges that we have courtroom deputies assigned to us all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38,day as opposed to only being signed during the day when we have in custody defendants typically even when we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45,finished our dockets we will have others who will come into the court courtrooms,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:51,to address additional business items or other issues or even those that might have warrants out that we have to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:57,address and so we think that it's very important that we have an adequate number of Court courtroom deputies,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04,um there with our court staff as well as us throughout the day while we're there as well as walking through the building,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:17,prominent issue around the nation and so we're asking for additional consideration again for Courthouse,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24,security to be ramped up um we are have been working with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:29,sheriff and opso on protocols and policies and procedures and so we just,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34,wanted to update the Council on that information so where are you though when it comes to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:40,getting the additional security you're still in conversations with opso yes we're still in conversations with opso,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:47,um about getting the additional officers um we are hopeful that in the next coming weeks especially,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:53,um after the Mardi Gras holiday especially that things will ramp up with respect to our additional officers being,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:00,in the court um but right now we we are definitely working with opso on that particular,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:06,issue um thank you we've had some assessments that have been done by some other uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:12,opso officers um in terms of the jury Lounge in the court jury rooms,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:18,um we are updating the jury Lounge we've had some water leakage into one of our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:24,newer uh constructed jury lounges so we're working on um renovations to that particular lounge,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30,and then for our jury rooms we understand we were provided with some funding some additional monies that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36,can utilize in order to do some renovations to our court dream rooms and so we appreciate that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42,um those plans have not yet started the renovations but hopefully will be underway uh fairly soon so thank you so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:49,much for that um support and and in the meantime what is the logistically where do you put,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:55,jurors when you do go under renovation so I think what we'll do and I'll let Mr Kasich proceed answer that a little bit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:01,more but I think what will happen is we will utilize the juries the the judge's conference room if we have um trials or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:09,we will switch courts because it's rare that in all 12 sections would be in a trial at any one time time so we can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15,maneuver that but Mr Casey do you want to add anything we have not heard I know the council promised us some uh Bond,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:21,money from the uh less hearing and we haven't met with anyone yet I've reached out to Capitol projects and they said,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:27,that the paperwork hasn't made it to them yet so I'm not sure where we stand with Capital Improvements um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:33,supposedly that was five million dollars dedicated for this project I've reached,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:39,out to Capital we're looking at steady planning we tried to meet with City Planning but they were tied up with something else so we're waiting to hear,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:45,back to see what's the next step for us to proceed with this funding got it well um we'll also um you know send some correspondence to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:52,try to push this along once we get with capital projects as a project manager assigned to it and they will assist us,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:57,on scheduling and facilitating how we move judges from one section it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:03,obviously going to be a disruption to their court so it'll be scheduled we've worked with capital projects in the past,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:09,on two other projects and it worked really well got it okay yeah thank you and so for the third update is technology we are happy to say that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18,are um there are technology updates that will be done to all of our court reporting systems our systems are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:23,probably two years older than um what we need them to be and so we have recently received funding as a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:30,result of our city council allocations to update all of our court so Court Reporting systems are audio systems so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:37,that we can have better transcription of um trials and hearings and Etc so we're we're happy about that we're also,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:44,continuing to use the virtual platform with zoom um in conjunction with that partnership with Doc Department of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:50,Public Safety and corrections as well as other uh in-state parishes so that those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:56,defendants who are in custody who don't necessarily need to be transported can appear via Zoom that helps us to get a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:03,case processing faster it also helps with security for those facilities as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:09,well as ojc and that ojc does not have to house additional in-custody defendants overnight or for an extended,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:15,period of time if it's not necessary and so there are a number of hearings that are sub that are not substantive and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:21,that don't require uh the defendants to be there in person by law they can appear via zoom and consent,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:28,um to that virtual appearance and so we're able to keep a lot of those defendants up to date on what's going on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:34,with their cases through Discovery or pre-trial hearings that way they're engaged with their attorneys we also,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:40,utilize still utilize the breakout rooms so that they can talk to the attorneys especially when they're in another Parish or when ndsc custody so we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:47,continuing to use the zoom virtual platform for that uh purpose our in-custody defendants are coming over to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:54,court more often a number of the judges at Criminal Court are now scheduling,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
7:00,in-custody defendants on a daily basis pretty much to come over to court to handle various cases so that's working,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
7:06,out and in recent discussions with uh the sheriff sheriff Hudson she's seen as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
7:11,a result a decrease in the population there because we are able to process,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
7:16,those cases and those persons who are serving doc time or those persons who,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
7:21,need to go to another Parish to address another issue we're able to address those cases so that they can move out of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
7:27,ojc and they're just not sitting there um and then uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
7:33,finally I think magistrate court is running well we have four uh very well,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
7:38,qualified experienced uh magistrate Commissioners um and we think that you know all is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
7:43,well in terms of the Commissioners and what they are doing um we are having quarterly meetings with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
7:49,our commissioners and they also have monthly access uh being supervised by judge Lombard and then of course by,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
7:55,Chief Pittman and I and so that's our updates unless you all have any questions any questions from,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
8:01,the Deus council president Murrell uh I'm sure you guys are aware of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
8:07,resolution the resolution we sent over regarding the South White interest entrance I know the council had,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
8:13,previously committed to a system providing the funding for the installation of the cameras I just want to see what is the status on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
8:20,that I know that that y'all met conversation with the district attorney on that and can we be of any assistance,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
8:25,to facilitating and getting that done quicker Mr Kasich we haven't received any notification from the council as to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
8:31,funding for the camera system this is the first I'm hearing about it okay well I know I've had conversation with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
8:37,judges directly and I've said the concern that I got from judges regarding the South White interest in the DA's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
8:42,office was that there were concerns that individuals would or could let people in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
8:47,that were not authorized to be in so the conversations we had which I had directly with I believe judge Pittman,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
8:53,and also with judge Cavalier was that the council would seek to relieve that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
8:58,issue by offering to install cameras at that entrance so that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
9:04,access could be restored to the DA's office to bring victims and Witnesses through that door and that judges could,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
9:10,maintain oversight to make sure that the appropriate people were using the door I've also met with councilman gerusso,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
9:16,who agreed and we said that we would facilitate the funding of the installation of the cameras to resolve,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
9:22,the issue and so we are I have I have had along with judge Pittman in our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
9:27,security um chair judge kimya Holmes as well as our co-chairs judge Milano Lombard,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
9:32,regarding um having a deputy opso deputy there along with the cameras and then also,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
9:39,establishing a protocol with the DA's office well I think the reason why we all we offered to do the camera is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
9:47,because we knew that due to the issues you have with opso if having a sheriff,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
9:53,present was going to be a requirement then it left the access to the door at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
9:59,the mercy of whether a sheriff would be present that's so the whole reason why we offered to but to front the funding for cameras was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
10:07,to not have the opening and closing of that door contingent upon a sheriff being present if the judge's position as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
10:14,a sheriff has to be present then at that point we don't need to give you funding for a camera because that defeats the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
10:19,purpose of having a camera there yes that that remains the position of the judges is that we definitely need an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
10:25,opso officer there so that they can check because the camera won't be able obviously to look into bags to do any,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
10:32,searches um to check anyone and so we the judges have previously talked about the fact,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
10:38,that we really would prefer as we do it all of the entrances the one on Tulane and South Broad to have an opso officer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
10:45,there as well and so judge Juana Lombard is but people coming in that door just,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
10:52,just with the camera I thought the camera was additional backup to stop so the problem we have and the sheriff and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
10:58,I even witnessed it on a security tour is that if a sheriff is not there people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
11:03,open the door from the inside so yeah you will see someone come in without a car key but you're not seen and it's not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
11:10,judicial employees but it's employees of the two other agencies operating in and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
11:16,around the courthouse um and it's not just D.A employees there's also clerks employees that open,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
11:23,the door and let people in the problem is if someone if I'm opening the door,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
11:28,for council member Moreno and someone else walks up to enter none of these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
11:34,people are going to get into an altercation or slam a door in someone's face and nor should they because they're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
11:41,not trained to do that and we've had issues that we can't go into but we've,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
11:46,had issues of things being brought into the courthouse that don't belong in the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
11:51,courthouse that could be a security issue for not just the judges but the general public so we have to have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
11:58,someone searching the bags as they're coming in the door because otherwise the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
12:04,DA's office is not searching the bags even though they could be but that's still not their responsibility so if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
12:10,someone brings a knife in a courtroom if someone brings the recorder in the courtroom I mean obviously nobody's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
12:16,going to smuggle a gun in the courtroom but we have had other things come into the court that we find and they are security issues which is why we're also,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
12:23,pressing Security in the courtrooms councilman Burrell is there an option for for us to have both the cameras,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
12:30,for that I think it's redundant I think if if we're going to make access now to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
12:35,be clear does anyone have access to the South white door at all right now sure yes our employees have access is they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
12:42,have the access key cards they're authorized uh to come into class I guess my position would be if you're our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
12:50,employees who are Court employees who are properly vetted have access in and out the purpose of doing the camera as a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
12:56,compromise was that the assumption would be that the DA's office also is officers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
13:02,of the Court who are bringing people that they are escorting from their office which has a metal,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
13:08,detector in which they do check bags that would be appropriate for them to use that to use that door with their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
13:15,swipe card if the people they brought through had gone through their security mechanisms was the purpose of the camera,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
13:21,was to assure judges and that was the Compromise I thought I'd negotiated but apparently it is not that they were only,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
13:28,bringing in the people that have been vetted through their office if the position of the judges is that is not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
13:34,sufficient then a camera is not necessary because you're gonna have a I will tell you what is bothersome to me,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
13:40,is all the examples you just gave your staff can do the same thing your staff could let someone in doing the same,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
13:45,thing with the card and to have a different standard for the other employees the court,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
13:52,it's one thing if you're just going to say South White is closed because there's what we have in there too but if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
13:58,your staff can still use it and other people cannot in my opinion on its face it's a double,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:04,standard because every every concern you have could apply to anyone using South,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:10,White including your staff with swipe card so for my purpose there's no reason to have a camera there if the door is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:17,going to remain unusable to anybody else unless the sheriff is present and I guess my frustration is I know from our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:25,last meeting I want to say in December and January we were all operating under the assumption this had been resolved,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:31,and it obviously has not been resolved and I'm not going to totally steal the Thunder from council member green but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:38,I am continually bothered by the idea that under the current policy of this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:43,court with the Sheriff's Office victims and Witnesses have to go through,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:49,the same door as defendants and the intimidation and the intimidation and other issues that they could face is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:56,problematic excuse me they do know that's the thing that we've been saying all along we have a door that only,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:03,attorneys and jurors can come through and that door is manned with a metal,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:09,detector and sheriffs and we have said repeatedly to the DA's office we are not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:15,asking you to walk them up the steps at Tulane and Broad we're asking you to come through the same side door that our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:21,jurors come through that the attorneys come through and there's no one else that comes through that door that door,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:28,is on the far other side of the building so the whole idea of South White being,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:34,available is the closest door to the DA's office is South White it's across,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:39,the street the other door you're offering to them would require them to walk around the entire perimeter of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:45,building either on the back end or the front end to get to the other entrance which still has the issue of when the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:52,people are queued up in front of the building to get inside which they are queued up because it's like a funnel I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:57,mean that's just the nature for security reasons and Valley so it's a funnel where people go through to make sure,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
16:03,that they're appropriately not armed or they're like you have to walk through,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
16:08,that area to get to the other door or best case scenario along the back side,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
16:15,of the building which is still problematic so like I said I'm disappointed this isn't resolved I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
16:20,thought we had it resolved obviously it's not and if it's not resolved I think that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
16:26,it needs to be resolved with a sense of urgency by the Sheriff's Office to staff,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
16:31,the door I think we agree we agree so and councilman morale I mean previously,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
16:36,there was such an agreement where the DA's office did have access that is when we had to develop the security protocol,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
16:44,to close South light basically because of the things and the Contraband that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
16:50,have been found in the court and because of the number of access people that were utilizing that South White Street side,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
16:57,we have control over our employees but we do not have control over other agency,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
17:02,employees whether or not they have access to the building so we had to take some precautionary measures I understand,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
17:08,your frustration we're frustrated as well but just like every other governmental building Federal Court,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
17:14,Jefferson Parish Court City Hall has certain protocols in place for entrances,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
17:20,and exits we would like the same type of treatment for everyone's safety and we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
17:27,do not have custody or control over anyone else other than our poor employees other people were bringing in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
17:34,Access members of their families um other kinds of Contraband that have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
17:39,gotten in over this past year and so we had to come up with a very strong policy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
17:45,about salt White Street for the protection and interests of everybody including the jurors who come into court,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
17:51,all of our staff and for everyone who works in criminal District Court we appreciate all of the work that you all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
17:58,have done we agree with you um but we just want you to know that it was not a knee-jerk reaction this is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
18:04,something that happened over time after careful consideration well I think that was the purpose of why I worked with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
18:10,council member jeruso to offer the compromise for having a camera at the location that way if there were,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
18:17,instances in which contradiction introduced into the building it would be a very simple issue for y'all to revoke,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
18:24,South White access if that was abused so that was my perspective the perspective,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
18:30,of any of my colleagues was that the whole purpose of the camera was if Contraband came into the South White,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
18:35,entrance or someone was let in that shouldn't have been let in you would have the discretion to see the DA's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
18:41,office or someone caused it and then you could lock down south white again but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
18:46,to deal with the Sheriff's Office and their Staffing is challenging and I remain concerned about the access itself,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
18:52,white so thank you just to be clear to ask a question okay uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
18:59,just wondering if this could potentially work so the district attorney has um I believe sheriff's deputies working,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
19:05,at the entrance of his office when he needs to walk people over would it be a possibility for him to be able to access,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
19:12,South White if he is walking over the individuals with one of the sheriff's deputies,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
19:18,and then that way you have a sheriff's deputy walking across the street with the individuals that sheriff's deputy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
19:24,you know could once again as the individuals are walking through uh make sure that no one has any type of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
19:29,Contraband make sure that no one is following in behind him everyone gets sent through the door safely and we move,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
19:34,along could that be a workable option so I mean that's what we're asking for is to have a sheriff's deputy at that door,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
19:40,but we need to be posted there this would be someone who's at the DA's office but when they're walking across,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
19:45,the street and and coming over that this sheriff's deputy would be escorting them,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
19:50,in making sure that everyone gets in safely uh that no one is following behind them that there are no extra,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
19:56,individuals coming in the door and you know can search for Contraband and then the person would this sheriff's deputy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
20:03,once everyone's in safely would go back to his post at the DA's office well I mean we can certainly discuss that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
20:08,particular option um if it's a sheriff's deputy who's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
20:15,post-certified um as opposed to a D.A investigator sure if that was sort of the difference,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
20:21,um that we had discussed before and just for clarity I guess at this time was the council's proposal or desire that this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
20:28,be reopened but this is just for victims and Witnesses and investigators correct,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
20:33,this isn't for the whole 100 and something employees in the DA's office that's coming in and out that's been our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
20:40,understanding okay District Attorney's Office yes okay any other questions council member,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

20:51,there's a private security agency would you be amicable to have a person who's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
20:56,like a private security person like we have at City Hall you can also man the doors absolutely if there's funding,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

50:44:00,number of people a youth For Whom the D.A did not charge in a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
50:50:00,timely manner could you give an explanation because on the face of it you suggested that it wasn't done in a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
50:56:00,timely manner how does the how do those discharges happen and are you all notified and then what happens with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
51:02:00,youth Who's involved with the program at the time so it's only three um they have the 819 discharge and the law states,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
51:09:00,that the charges have to be brought um in a timely manner so which is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
51:15:00,roughly 72 hours and if a kid is not brought um the case is not petitioned or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
51:23:00,or not seen in in court charges are not broad then the kids should be rightfully,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
51:28:00,released from jjicic and so uh what myself and my team has done we have a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
51:35:00,specific social work for dedicated to making sure that each and every child receive due process and so at the end of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
51:43:00,the 72 hours we are before the end of the 72 hours we are reaching out to their attorneys and we're saying it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
51:50:00,day two we're approaching day three um you need to see if this if if this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
51:56:00,kid is going to have his day in court or be prepared to uh petition the court for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:02:00,his or her release and so um when the deadline is missed they petition the courts and then those kids,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:09:00,they file a petition with the judge and by a lot of judge signs off because this kid has to be released it hasn't had his,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:16:00,day in court you know she hasn't had that day in court that's your that's your social work worker who files in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

52:27:00,to keep the uh attorneys that represent the kids on their tools to say listen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:34:00,time is of the essence if this kid doesn't get seen in court by such and such time tomorrow let's just say 12,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:41:00,noon or the end of Court this kid it was there in violation of of these kids,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:47:00,rights and so you should be filing a petition to have this kid released so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:53:00,the number that you gave was three yeah so it was 129 what we call discharges,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
52:59:00,but then we have subcategories so out of the 129 43 of those I don't have to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
53:05:00,slide up but 43 of those were considered non-detension I mean the DA's office looked at it and decided they weren't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
53:12:00,going to petition the case or bring charges so those kids will automatically release for whatever charges that they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
53:18:00,were brought in on the 3 8 19 you are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

53:37:00,get a reasoning from the D.A and the D.A can answer this when he comes up as to why they did not file in a timely manner,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
53:43:00,what period of time is that that we're talking about 72 hours no no over those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

54:52:00,department and sometimes we reach out to members of the DA's office and say are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
54:58:00,y'all gonna is this going to be treated as a land detention are y'all going to bring charges we are approaching the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:04:00,deadlines okay so of the 129 discharge is approximately 43 were of the district,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:11:00,attorney deciding that the charges were not meritable if you will correct all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:16:00,right we didn't know what they thought because they missed the deadline and then the 75,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:23:00,was court ordered where judges saw kids in court and made decisions either to place release them until the parents or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:30:00,release them to other programs like the evening Reporting Center mellow Grove,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:36:00,um the judges uh those were had went through the adjudication process as it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:41:00,was supposed to you use terms such as entered and discharged so if there were,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:46:00,105 and it's 129,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:52:00,discharges yes does that mean that there are now 24 additional bids available at the JJ IC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
55:59:00,no that means this was the last quarter so this was so this means and so when,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:06:00,you see 129 we may have they may have this child some discharges from the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:12:00,previous quarters because the average Olympic stand jjic is supposed to be anywhere from,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:18:00,one hour to 15 days but in in New Orleans I'ma just be honest they may,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:24:00,stay anywhere from 30 days to three years so some of those adjudications although we only took in 105 during that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:32:00,quarter 129 were adjudicated uh a discharge but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:39:00,some of the 129 may have come from another quarter of previous years I appreciate your honesty because if you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:45:00,did mention something that's a significant concern but I'll ask about it those eight youth,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
56:52:00,adults that were transferred to ojc that were eight that's different so oh no no,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

59:07:00,birthday so 17 going into 18 we will be transferring those and grown men or women at that time to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:16:00,the adult population at ojc that's the new policy that's consistent,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:22:00,because I've heard concerns it's the law right yeah I lead to law for a long time right I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:29:00,hate to see it I'm trying to you know councilman Thomas can help me sometimes by being just straightforward we've been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:35:00,violating the law for a long time but you know the problem with the violation of the law is that those who might be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:41:00,there at age 14 and 13 are in the same facility with 18 and 19 year olds,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:47:00,sometimes who are up for adult charges versus burglary or possession or things,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:52:00,like that and that's a great disservice to the young persons who might be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
59:57:00,interested in Rehabilitation unless you tell me that I'm that something's wrong why are we violating the law,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:04,well when they're 18 and they're being adjudicated as adults um lawfully they should be transferred,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:11,to an adult facility however I have to be honest and transparent with you you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:16,they will have some men or women at age 18 still residing at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:24,jgic if they are being adjudicated as juveniles meaning if the crime happened,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:30,at 15 and for whatever reason the case didn't move in a timely manner for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:35,whatever reason and now they're 18 if they're still being adjudicated as a juvenile until that adjudication process,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:43,meaning they don't went to the courts and they've been found delinquent they will have to remain at jjicic until uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:50,post adjudication only on juvenile charges but if they are being tried,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:00:56,um as an adult they have to at midnight of their 18th birthday be transferred to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:01,ojc in your in your experiences which are vast what is the oldest that you've,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:07,seen a youth or person in jji scene age 20. what were the charges,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:14,murder so you had someone in jjicic in your experience who was charged with murder yes around 13 year olds charged,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:21,with burglary right but lawfully income DCFS compliance everybody age makes a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:28,difference so they have to be housed differently separate and apart from um the juveniles and even when they're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:35,being adjudicated as juveniles and they have to be school different and that's what I think the public don't understand,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:41,it's difficult in a very small space to try to and where kids have the rights,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:48,and education to separate the two and we work very hard to do that right and I want the public to be aware because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:01:54,sometimes there's rumor versus fact but you know you're presenting facts right now but it's important to follow the law,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:00,and as a reason that the law exists and um that's on a lot of people other than ourselves but at the end of the day a 20,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:07,year old incarcerated at the jgiic for murder is much different from a 13 year,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:12,old who is accused of juvenile delinquent type I agree and I hope that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:17,we will follow the law and you know whatever needs to be done I know I need to I know the district attorney can get,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:22,involved with that but um it's a challenge for someone because you did say like education the grow program you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:29,participate in the grow program you don't have just individual instruction for somebody who's 20 years old who's in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:35,there for murder correct it's in a room with someone who's 13 years old who's subject to burglary,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:41,it can put a strain on the teachers because Travis he'll make every attempt,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:46,to educate every person in the ggic and so sometimes it's like because of that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:53,age group can't be in the actual School setting we have to send teachers to them,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:02:59,I appreciate your sincerity thank you very much unfortunately that's not a a phenomenon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:06,a rare and unnatural occurrence because it happens in the school system right,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:13,you know so uh we need to eliminate that uh from society the other thing is thank,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:19,you for your questioning councilman but you can't answer for the district attorney correct you can only answer for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:25,the process and when you talk about folk who adjudicated to the criminal justice system uh you know a lot of more other,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:32,things that come in uh to play when you talk about how you segregate them how you house them or where you keep them,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:38,based on the adult the adult system and the juvenile system so there are certain,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:44,laws and processes that mandate what you do so to say that you would want best practices to do this then you also,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:51,relying upon the system to do what it has to do on instance the clearest space except this person adjudicate them into,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:58,the system that they've aged out to and if that doesn't happen then the placement has to be where they're placed correct,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:05,okay okay um I have a a just a couple questions uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:11,I have I have a standard question for and I hope that everyone who's coming before this committee has thought about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:16,this our our new uh Police Superintendent has uh released a plan uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:22,that uh Metropolitan crime commission to others are calling promising in terms of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:28,the three points uh have you guys read that plan I haven't even seen the plan I have not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:34,I'ma just be honest with you okay okay okay I've read it okay well,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:42,I think you know Ground Zero for everything is you would hope would be the family but in criminal justice uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:49,Ground Zero is what happens with uh men and women on the front line for law enforcement as you guys uh since you oversee uh the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:58,juvenile uh Detention Center as you take a look at that plan uh how does it or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:04,will it have you guys what you haven't seen it so y'all haven't talked about it how will it impact what you guys do at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:10,the Juvenile Center because this plan is going to have especially as it moves forward it's going to have impact on the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:16,entire system so everyone needs to be versed in it as it relates to their part of the Criminal Justice System,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:23,uh just speaking with Chief we'll talk on some of the truancy and some of the other initiatives that she's taking um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:29,taking on you're going to work hand in hand with her with the Juvenile Justice intervention Center as well as the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:34,Intensive and I appreciate you and also uh councilman jerusal for being a part of the meeting yesterday as we worked,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:05:47,all the council persons up there that uh assist us and help us in the juvenile but we're working closely with the chief,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:53,Wolf Park as she created our initiatives and as we go through the plan as it relates to her making arrests and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:59,everything how are we going to actually bring those kids in and when they come into and we talked about some of the um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:05,screening processes uh yesterday that we're gonna uh judge dansbury was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:10,talking about initiating that as they bring in there we're going to try to do jjicic initiate some of those processes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:17,in conjunction with the police department instead of them keep arresting people over and over and over that we get to some type of intervention,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:23,well I'm working closely hanging in hand with uh Chief workflow to make sure that we were hanging hanging with the police,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:29,department as the juveniles coming in they're then I see him coming right back out on the street and come in the same,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:34,crime over and over so she has I think the plan is good she has a lot of trunks,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:39,you have a lot of things that deals specifically with juveniles and uh we're going to work hand in hand with her to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:45,make sure that we uh support our initiative well I'm going to ask each stakeholder that question because it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:50,time to uh stop throwing stuff on the board and hoping it sticks,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:57,and as I've talked to criminal justice experts around this country they said if this is going to be a plan,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:02,there needs to be a central plan that everybody buys into the public doesn't continue to need to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:09,be confused since experts say it's a good plan we all need to buy it because I could have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:15,a my idea is about a criminal justice plan too but I don't have police force,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:21,I'll have a ticket book I don't have a jail to put them in I don't have a court for him to go through,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:27,so as I've since the plan is released because I don't know everything I'm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:32,going out I've called and I've talked to other people uh throughout the system to say what what is the one best thing we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:39,can do since we have a plan and that and the answer was that we could all be proficient understand it and buy into,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:46,the plan and support the plan so it doesn't mean that they're on other things because I'm always ready for the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:51,comments it doesn't mean that there's there's another things that people should do but since we have a plan,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:57,emanating from the police department I would think that you would be proficient in terms of understanding and studying I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:04,would think that I would understand and study it in every part of the Criminal Justice System would understand and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:10,study it and either say they don't think it'll work for their part of the system or it will work but they're part of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:16,system but I'm just tired of throwing stuff at this at the sticky board and hoping something fits when I say council,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:22,member I will definitely read the things in Cincinnati I was aware,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:29,of myself and being a rental response over and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:36,running and that's not a criticism of anybody what we've consistently heard and is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:42,that working together works right so that even though things that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:49,both want to initiate it let it bubble up through the plan and see how it complements the plan that's what I'm a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:56,Moreno thank you Mr chair just kind of in that same vein um I I have not um received the plan,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:04,um nor have other council members so I think if if we could share that plan that would be uh very helpful,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:10,um as well and let me say that you know if if you if anybody here if you want council members,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:16,to be supportive if you want people to because everybody here has ideas we have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:22,people who know probably more about the police department like outside and others and councilmember Marino and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:29,councilmember King in in folk and I've been around a little while I think it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:34,extremely important that we all be educated up to the same point we cannot,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:40,have initiatives where you're saying here this is what I want to do and I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:45,don't know anything about what you want to do that that's not going to work it doesn't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:50,get people to buy in so I'm going to ask everyone who comes here you know if they've read the plan,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:56,how they feel about the plan and if they're bought into the plan council member morale,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:08,sorry uh yeah do I need to throw the Geico flag yes a couple of points I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:15,think to Echo councilman Moreno's points I do think there's been a kind of a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:21,theme that we've dealt with over the course of the last year regarding criminal justice,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:26,which is that many of the criminal justice Partners find out about plans was a press,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:31,conference and then it was kind of left upon us to go figure out what the plan,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:36,is by going to see how the newspapers reported I will say that I think that any plan or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:44,any effort to deal with crime in the City of New Orleans though it involves the nopd is not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:51,necessarily nopd Centric I think what you've seen from this Council in the last couple of months with many of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:56,initiatives we've pushed in particular with what's going on nlpd have not been in OPD Center because we're trying to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:02,give nopd room to breathe to establish what they want to do but that being said Partners like yourself Partners like the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:09,school board Partners like a variety of other agencies like the Department of Health there are initiatives that we can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:16,push to deal with the underlying issues that deal with crime that being said it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:22,is very difficult to work as a cohesive unit and I have been and will continue to be very critical of the current crime,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:30,task force for that specific reason it's like the plans we've seen throw at press conferences,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:36,we don't really have as a council as stakeholders a clear idea of where,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:42,things are going we don't have clear briefings on a daily weekly or monthly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:49,basis where we're being led and in the absence of having those clear,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:58,conversations from the administration on where this plan is going the people of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:04,the City of New Orleans are not going to stand by and not be led and so what you see from the council and what we've been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:09,doing with a variety of initiatives many members have pushed is in the absence of clear leadership we're trying to show,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:16,what initiatives we believe that are working with stakeholders like yourself like the school board like the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:22,Department of Health in a variety of other groups to lead us somewhere safe,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:28,because in the course of less than a year we've seen 180 88 page plan from,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:28:12,how this would work the mental health professional or social worker which would work in conjunction with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:19,intake specialist would be a 8 30 a.m to 4 P.M on Mondays through Friday,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:25,a mental health professional would also assess any of the children who came in because as we know this is a 24-hour,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:30,operation which would include a mental health professional from 7 A.M to 3 P.M,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:36,Monday through Friday mental health professional from 3 P.M to 11 P.M Monday,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:28:53,7 P.M Saturday and Sunday and all in both Saturdays and Sundays so as you can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:28:59,see the request is that this would be 24 hours where we will not only have access,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:04,to determine the race score of why the kid was brought in initially but also to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:09,assess those needs that that family or that child May possess and while we do provide this request that we understand,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:16,that this would have to go in conjunction with Community Partnerships and persons in the community who are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:22,already running Services of where these referrals could be made once that need is assessed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:27,the contract position which would be five of them for a total of forty five thousand seven,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:34,hundred and fifty four dollars per person so if we look at the amount that would be paid would be forty thousand,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:41,plus the additional benefits for a total of forty five thousand if we look at the one two three four positions that we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:48,asking that be funded full-time as well as the two positions on the weekends from the 7 A.M to 7 PM shift this is for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:29:56,a total cost of 232 232 thousand dollars,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:01,nine two hundred two hundred thirty two thousand nine hundred thirty six dollars for supplies and equipment a total of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:08,seventeen thousand nine hundred and sixty dollars and for workshops a total,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:14,of seven thousand five hundred for a total projected budget of 258,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:20,396 dollars this would allow the juvenile court and the judges to have an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:26,additional screening assessment which is not only being used in Jefferson Parish Cato parish and many juvenile agencies,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:33,across the United States and we feel that this would provide an additional layer of support not only for the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:40,families but also an additional layer of support for the communities and would allow us to continue the collaboration,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:47,that we have been working so diligently to continue to beef up the lack of a better word,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:30:54,um with not only nopd as we are aware we hear conversations about kids that are coming in those kids may be arrested on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:01,one charge and take it from a judge I've got a kid that comes in that kid is arrested on unauthorized use of a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:07,movable I might may not determine until later than those 72 hours in which that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:12,child has to have their initial hearing that there are many other factors many other instances or many other possible,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:19,um acts that that child may have been involved in by having a social worker who is doing an assessment so that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:25,know what neighborhood what factors what trauma what other family members that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:31,have been involved in the system what lack of resources what school issues would chronic absenteeism what issues,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:39,are these children dealing with that if we see them today and we allow them to be released without doing these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:45,necessary assessments and having this information means that we may possibly see that child tomorrow and so we are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:51,posing an additional layer which will provide us the opportunity and the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:31:56,ability to have an assessment because of the judge I am not a social worker I do not have that information to my disposal,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:04,that would tell us what are some of the ways and some of the things that we can do to have better outcomes I believe,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:11,that we all want a safer New Orleans we all want a better place to live but we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:17,also want more for our youth and have them have an opportunity to do something different so maybe if we have a better,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:25,idea of what we're dealing with have a better idea and a better assessment of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:30,what other factors have that they have to address and we have a better idea and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:35,a better understanding of where we're sending them back to and we have a better idea and a better understanding,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:40,of what mental health what issues that they need dealing with we can then work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:46,together in a collaborated effort along with all of the partners that have presented themselves here today yep,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:32:54,um even a Reporting Center there are so many uh so many agencies so many,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:00,community-based agencies that have the ability and could reach out to our kids,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:05,but we aren't connecting the dots and I think that is a big need I think that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:11,have heard the message that in order to bring our city back and work together that we have got to figure out how to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:17,collaborate communicate and talk about it and part of doing that is to have an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:22,assessment and a tool that we all have the ability to use where we can make the best outcomes and best decisions,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:32,today we propose for your consideration that Orleans Parish Juvenile Court,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:39,Juvenile Assessment Center implementing needs-based assessments at the earliest,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:44,opportunity the moment those kids touch that system is a Beck's practice that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:49,has been recommended by the Louisiana State University Institute for Public Health and Justice in a 2013 report,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:33:55,which is the chat sharp proposal and has shown positive results in neighboring,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:34:01,jurisdictions we thank you for your time and we would ask that we go to slide three and also I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:34:06,think what we talked about is that approximately one thousand two hundred and twenty eight youth came through intake for the period of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:34:14,January 1st of 2022 until December 31st of 2022. our proposed budget in the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:34:21,amount of 258 000 is an average of 210 dollars per use whereas the national,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:34:28,average of every time that a youth is being detained is forty seven thousand dollars per use so I believe that if we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:34:35,do the math it's cost effective if we talk about what we are all discussing is collaborating and communicating and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:34:42,working together we're bringing all the Community Partners under one umbrella and we are given the opportunity for a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:34:49,safer City and better outcomes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:34:59,and just as we end our presentation um obviously someone who meant quite a bit to many of us I sat on some boards,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:35:06,with her but I think that she said it best and we'd like to end with a quote from his Barbara Lason Keller you can't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:35:12,do everything it can do something so here's our opportunity to do something and we thank,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:35:18,you for your time today thank you John councilmember Marina thank you good morning to to you all uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:35:25,with the Personnel uh funding for those on the 232 936 are you all working with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:35:31,the CAO to try to get these particular positions filled because he he he has,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:35:36,built the budget as kind of at need basis that if you're adding more positions that he would work with with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:35:42,different agencies to try to fund those particularly on the public safety side so we're working with the co but we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:35:47,also working with uh commissioner Tanisha Stevenson um and I think that we I know that we had a meeting on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:35:52,yesterday in fact I believe council member Thomas was there and councilmember jerusal understanding he's not present today,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:35:58,um as well as a commissioner as well as some of our partners and I believe that there has been some funding that um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:36:04,councilmember Jerusalem did place um with the criminal justice coordination with our commissioner,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:36:10,Stevens to the office but I believe that they're making sure that there's like sustainability so this is not a one-time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:36:15,um I would defer to the budget with the budget people I know we make requests we do that yearly um but our budget pretty,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:36:21,much pretty much the budget book that we receive is a budget book that stays so there's been very little deviation so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:36:27,we're trying other ways of I guess trying to see if this could possibly be funded as well as reaching out to other,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:36:33,resources yeah definitely work directly if you can and I'm happy to make the connection uh with the cio's office for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:36:40,you all to work directly with with them on Personnel Staffing up because they uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:36:45,like I said early on made the commitment that should there be an additional positions needed for different agencies,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:36:51,that they would work with the different agencies particularly Public Safety agencies to get those positions uh filled so um just work with them I'm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:36:58,happy to connect you all the other question that I have is what is your what is your caseload annually for the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:03,whole Court foreign,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:09,in terms of like how many cases I handled last year we could provide that information to you we've wait I think we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:15,may have that I think usually the Supreme Court keeps those numbers yes we do and we do turn on those numbers quarterly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:21,okay well she looks up that information um of a kind of a follow-up to that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:26,so when you have cases like let's take a a case that that that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:33,happens to be we'll just call her Jane Doe okay Jane Doe um is coming has a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:38,particular case against her she's coming before you judge Bates if there are future issues with Jane Doe,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:47,is everything referred back to your section or does it go to different sections of Court can it be referred,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:37:53,anywhere like does it is referred back to that section so what we try to do is one family one judge so if I have a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:00,particular Jane Doe and she receives a our Jane those are doing much better though council member I might add event,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:06,we're not seeing a lot of Jane those that are coming back but if that should happen right and if that should happen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:11,uh it will be then sent to that judge so even though it's an allotment so every case is allotted if I so if it's a c,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:18,case and I don't get that particular case an allotment then emotion is made or even the judge will do it on its own,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:23,motion this kid already has an active case in section c and it'll be transferred to my section to follow the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:28,other cases the only time that may change is if those persons come in with co-defendants so if multiple kids come,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:35,in on one case that case is not always immediately transferred back to me but once the case is determined whether,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:42,there's an adjudication once that happens then that shot would be transferred back to me if it is for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:47,probation or um secure placement yeah because that was my that was my question to make sure that you know that there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:38:54,would be consistency with dealing with a child and a family that if you judge Bates were already familiar with a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:39:00,situation that you would be like following this this child and family all the way through the through the process,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:39:06,and they weren't being you know put in all different sections of Court where a new judge would have to learn the whole,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:39:11,situation when when you know you may already have the story no and every section also has a youth and family,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:39:17,specialist that is assigned to that judge and so that is a social worker that works with the judge in the sense,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:39:23,of talking with the other social workers to try to make sure that we're continuing this the already the effort and the care that has already been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:39:29,placed with that child so we try to file because imagine if if you have everybody telling you something different it can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:39:34,become very confusing for a child so we try to make sure that that child is sent back to the section in which they were,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:39:40,already in did you get the numbers I did but it's very small and I don't have all my glasses so um I believe that the total,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:39:47,amount was seven thousand sixty three cases last year and that was from last year,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:39:55,7063 so out of five judges each one of you has roughly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:40:01,you know but with that counts is so we don't count judge cook Calvin because she actually does child need of care so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:40:07,that's a separate count this is in regard to the delinquency cases so that would be amongst the four judges amongst,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:40:12,the four judges got it got it okay so you know almost 2 000 cases per judge,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:40:18,per section give or take and then we also have to realize so with with juvenile cases so they may come in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:40:23,they've got an appearance to answer um and I guess we pretty much see them more often so if they are adjudicated,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:40:28,delinquently they're on probation they're seen every 30 days if they're in Secure placement uh they're seeing every,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:40:34,60 days there's just certain mandates in which we see uh the children pretty regular so even though we may have had,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:40:40,7063 cases that are filed that doesn't mean that we're not touching those lives more often I got it all right thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:40:46,Mr chair uh thank you Council uh councilmember uh councilwoman jerusal councilman Moreno,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:40:53,before you step out uh councilmember Russo has been really consistent at uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:40:59,asking folk about recurring versus non-recurring funds and there are a lot of initiatives where uh people want,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:05,funding but his follow-up question is well how do we consistently fund this stuff especially if it works since,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:11,that's been I know a challenge that most of our council members are concerned about but he's been consistently thank,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:17,you any other council members no,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:23,councilmember Harris thank you judge thank you how many children are serviced through the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:28,evening Reporting Center per year I I would defer to Pastor Watson in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:34,regard to that number because again every section can make referrals she can also receive referrals,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:41,um and from intake so they're just different ways in which she receives her referral so I really would feel more,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:46,comfortable if she would answer that question okay but I can tell you that the kids that do work with ERC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:51,um it has been very successful and quite effective okay and then what about there's the grow program and then,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:41:57,there's another program that there's the grow program which is girls reaching out works wonders and there's also mellow,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:02,program which is men engaging in leadership opportunities work uh and all of those programs all see uh different,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:08,kids based on referrals so some of those kids get refer to intake some of those kids are referred From the Bench some of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:15,those kids are referred from continued custody um and some of them just almost refer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:20,themselves they ask if they are involved in an outcome uh we're also using some of those programs with incentive in-home,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:26,uh doing sort of dual referrals some of those kids are also being referred to those programs even if they're going,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:32,through diversion okay so those programs are in lieu of custody within jjic or that is correct those are the programs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:39,with the children that are being released and then the program through jjicic are usually kids that are um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:44,a little bit more serious offenses um and they're part of the Intensive in-home supervision which means that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:51,they would come in and then do some intensive work with those kids for 90 days okay and then there's Teen Court I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:42:56,know which I'm very interested in yes thank you I know you have participated and shown up for team court so we do appreciate that team court is a really,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:03,just what it says it's where kids are being judged by their peers and you have continued funding for that right because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:08,I know there was some issue about getting funding lost we've had lots of issues with getting funding and I do appreciate everybody saying to go to the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:15,CEO's office but again I think that's what pretty much every agency is doing and so I think what happens is you know there's a lot of us asking for the same,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:22,piece of the prize so that's why we're trying to work together so that's why we know um that there's a lot of ask and we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:28,trying to be minimal and this is where we really thought we could see a lot of Effectiveness listen if we're if we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:33,given a million dollars to Mardi Gras an additional that's what I say one of these kids an opportunity you'd be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:39,amazed at what they could do let me let me just finish my statement if we're giving a million dollars to additional law and officers which I agree with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:46,wholeheartedly since Mardi Gras is a driver of the economy of not only New Orleans but Louisiana we can make the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:53,investment in our children as well and so we're operating at a surplus so as my grandmother said if you don't ask you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:43:59,don't get so you need to make the ask for what you want um and I appreciate you asking council,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:04,member jerusal council member Thomas and presenting today about these additional services that you need,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:10,can you talk to me about the 72-hour whole the continued custody hearing how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:15,does that work so you have to have the hearing within 72 hours is that correct that is correct so once you challenge,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:20,the team they must be seen by that judge within 72.2 hours of their arrest and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:25,how often does it happen is it 100 of the time oh yeah it happens I mean the majority of the time that we have those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:32,hearings within 72 hours the only thing that may sometimes change um obviously if the lawyers come in and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:37,answer some additional time uh it depends on what type of charge the child has received in addition to that I know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:44,that um when you receive the booking sheet um that sometimes some of those children are rebooked,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:49,um or there's some additional offenses that may um have that may come up obviously I know that uh Chief woodfork,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:44:55,is here and they'll be able to talk about that but sometimes you know you're arrested kid and then obviously after,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:01,um some work is done in warrants are signed and additional police work is done and those children will be rebooked,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:06,on some additional offenses so the lawyers will come in and ask for additional time to have that hearing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:12,okay and there's a set detention judge just so I may be clear so every month each judge rotates into a detention,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:19,month so every month one of us are on call for 24 hours in which we're the detention judge that means we sign any,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:25,and all warrants uh we handle any and all um children in need of care issues uh we handle any and all uh continue,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:32,custodies uh we handle any and all issues that may present themselves uh within that 24-hour time span to the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:39,court okay and then I the jjic um report for the last quarter of 2022,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:47,said 75 court ordered um discharges that's because these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:52,children have served their sentences or are going someplace else how does that work there's just a number of reasons so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:45:57,some of those children can have matters that are pending in other jurisdictions and so uh they are being transferred,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:46:03,there um some of those children um go to trial and they're adjudicated not delinquent and they're subsequently,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:46:09,released some of those children come before a judge and determine that they are going to go forward and enter an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:46:15,admission and then those kids are then transferred if the result is that they're going to receive some type of other placement they are transferred to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:46:22,a different facility some of those children do present some mental health issues in which they have to be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:46:27,transferred for hospitalization so there's a number of reasons of why those children may be transferred okay and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:46:34,then for the ass that you're asking for these folks would basically be working 24 hours,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:46:40,yeah 24 hours 365 because that is a person who would actually do the mental,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:46:46,assessment the part that a social worker does that as much as we want to do I mean my grandmother was a social worker,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:46:52,I come from a family of social workers and as we know the social workers are the ones who are going to see what those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:46:58,children need understand some of those needs so they would work in conjunction with our intake okay and then these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:47:03,salaries that you have which is basically forty five thousand dollars for full-time people and then 24 for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:47:10,part-time this is market rate or I don't believe it's I don't it's not I mean I'm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:47:17,sure there are a lot of social workers that are probably in the audience and listening perhaps to our presentation they're trying to figure out how we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:47:22,going to find a social worker for that amount that's that's my question too you've had this here and if you can't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:47:27,find again if you don't ask you don't get if you need more money for this and ask for what you need to get a social,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:47:33,worker because it's it's like the recruiting stuff right like right if we're not paying to get somebody into,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:47:39,this position then it's useless to have this money in your budget so I I would encourage you to either ask civil,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:47:45,service or somebody to come up with what the market will bear and then ask for that amount of money thank you council,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:47:51,member thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:48:25,opportunity to work with many um but it's been very impressive just early on you know some of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:48:30,implementation that's happened some of the ways that we are collaborating to talk about and not disclose any information about a child but you know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:48:37,some of the kids um and how we can work um I see that we're also looking at um you know just how do we retain the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:48:44,people that are here because it just having consistency in the court you know we've got a trial that set and those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:48:49,police officers are showing up uh they're coming forward um they're present they have their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:48:54,reports they're prepared you know all all of that makes a difference some we can only do so much with what's provided,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:49:00,in front of us but again if a child is going to trial and there's a matter that's set then we have to have the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:49:05,evidence and we have to have what we need so uh working together with um being able to get our evidence that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:56:14,prosecutors that screen the case and meet the victims initially maintain the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:56:20,case throughout the case and and ultimately try it or plead it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:56:27,so that the the family members or the victims of homicides don't have to have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:56:33,a panoply of Adas that they have to deal with over the course of the life of that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:58:29,whatever that Juvenile Diversion program looks like that you know it comes in a way that the council is fully informed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:58:36,and that you know the city also has an opportunity to advise on uh what's happening there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:58:41,uh one of the things that our you know Juvenile Diversion Chief is uh is very,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:58:48,much promoting is an opportunity to have a mental health expert uh to have the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:58:53,opportunity to communicate with the children who find their way to our office,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:59:04,number of children who come in and they fit the eligibility to a t you know and it's an easy decision about you know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:59:10,making that option of the version available to them but what she's also pointed out is that there are some,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:59:16,unique circumstances where children might have mental exceptionalities where they might not otherwise qualify for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:59:22,diversion but that some more serious Hands-On uh support might be needed yes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:59:28,sir you know when you start this presentation you said how helpful it was to have the presentation before and now,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:59:41,about mental health and investing in mental health up to 260 000 then if the interests are the same,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:59:48,is there any way of you guys working together to combine those resources,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:59:54,especially since it's kind of part of the same system the same case the same,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:59:59,kid have you guys had conversations since the juvenile courts talking mental health you guys are talking Mental,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:00:11,together to say how can we do something and combine our resources no no and that's a wonderful Point uh we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:18,have not had an opportunity to meet with juvenile court thus far okay but it's one of those things that's absolutely front of Mind as we're having a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:24,conversation with our internal team okay so now that they've brought it up you guys can get together and talk about how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:30,you know maybe it might be nice for everybody to do their own thing but if we can do it together and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:36,maximize resources we can have resources for something else certainly okay thank you thank you sir,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:42,I'm sorry to cut you off it's thought that was a good point always so I do want to kick it now to Andre to talk a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:48,little bit about you know a an idea that came up in our leadership meetings that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:53,the the office is now planning to execute on that involves district screeners with bringing office a little,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:00:59,closer to the community uh I took over as chief of screening uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:05,in the summer of last year uh and as I did one of the first things I did was try to make our office more efficient,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:10,and I can't help but uh shout out to Lieutenant Powell is here today who worked very closely with our office and increasing the efficiency with which you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:17,received their police reports the attachments the other things so that we could allow our Adas to focus on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:23,actually reviewing the cases and not on tracking down every last piece of report or ass piece of evidence in doing so But,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:30,as time went on uh and as we worked with the a case officers assigned to each district it became clear that we were,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:37,missing a excellent opportunity to tackle crime in a fundamentally new way so often an ADA is focused with blinders,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:47,on to the singular facts of one particular case one particular flavor of crime we have our homicide screeners we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:54,have our sex crime screeners we have our narcotics screeners we have our gun crime screeners we have General crime,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:01:59,screeners and that approach uh can bear fruit in the sense that those screeners become good at understanding the ins and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:06,outs of those particular flavors of crime unfortunately it leaves us missing the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:11,forest for the trees and many opportunities and so one of the things we're doing is reorganizing our office to a district screener position that has,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:18,eight Ada screeners inside each of nopd's police districts who will be the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:23,primary point of contact for East of the nopd district commanders they will also liaison with Community elements,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:30,neighborhood associations business organizations citizens groups to work to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:35,begin to crowdsource and understand not just crime stats in general I mean,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:42,in reality crime stats are nothing new right we know where crime occurs nopd has an entire data analytics component,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:48,dedicated to knowing where these particular crimes are occurring what we're missing is when we overlay the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:53,urban environment of New Orleans about where crime is happening and maybe why it's happening that we gain an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:02:58,opportunity to actually respond with non-criminal Justice tools and stop future crime from occurring for example,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:05,if we are engaging with the community in the right way on a district level we're getting to understand the patterns of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:11,crime within that Community we're getting to understand that maybe a sequence of street lights that are out,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:16,on a particular block across from a bunch of blighted properties adjacent to an apartment complex with an absentee,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:22,out of state landlord who's not in compliance with permitting who's across the corner from a 24 7 alcohol,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:29,convenience store that has somebody selling heroin out of the back of it might be the fundamental reason we keep,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:35,seeing possession of heroin arrest human trafficking arrests gun crimes arrests,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:40,in that area because that's what's going wrong that that is the soil from which the crime is springing for 30 years,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:45,exactly right so if we're opening ourselves up to understanding why crime is happening in an area we can begin to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:52,use non-law enforcement tools we can coordinate with the council the council member's staff,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:03:57,so we can coordinate with city services we can Advocate and almost a community Ombudsman role or Community Advocate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:03,role to try to fix some of these problems now the DA's office will never have a bulldozer and roll over a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:09,blighted property it will never fix a street light but as our position and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:14,reviewing both criminal statistics knowing where crime occurs but also knowing where the victims of crime live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:20,where the defendants who commit those crimes where they stay what neighborhoods they're coming out of it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:26,gives us an absolutely unique perspective to act in a way that we have not acted before so I see this as a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:33,tremendous opportunity to have a paradigm shift in the way that we target not just our cases right with our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:39,blinders on focusing on the particular merits of each and every case but on focusing on the roots of crime across,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:44,the city so these district screeners will be one part screener right and one,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:49,park community outreach and activists trying to focus on why and how crime is occurring in each particular Regional,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:04:56,Air area now we've also been fortunate this past fall to been the recipient of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:01,a co-sup grant that's the comprehensive opioid stimulant and substance use program that gave us the capability to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:09,fund an additional data analytics uh data analysis sorry a data analyst over,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:17,nopd we're also supplementing our current data analyst with a database,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:23,engineer and a GIS mapping specialist to try to map out our Urban environment in a fundamentally new way not only to use,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:29,this information to guide what we're doing but also to bring it back bring it back to the communities bring it back to those neighborhood organizations and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:35,show them where we see overlays where we see uh concurrent issues in our Urban landscape,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:42,overlapping with where crime is occurring and where that map of suffering can guide us and I think this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:47,gives us a tremendous opportunity to change the way we prosecute uh and also,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:53,gives us a chance to I think heal some of the issues with trust between the citizens of New Orleans and New Orleans,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:05:59,Parish DA's office council member Thomas may I absolutely councilmember Harris so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:04,several things I I think it's a great plan of action I think that this new task force that 3-1-1 is organizing is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:12,also trying to do the same thing with elevating blooded properties light outages we certainly as District uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:19,council members know where the blight is know where the crime is know where everything is and have called on DPW,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:24,safety and permits code enforcement to get out to do something about it and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:29,have for the past year and a month we also have a blight and crime map that is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:35,hosted um so I just want to make sure all of these efforts are coordinated because it seems like we're all trying to get to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:41,the same problem in the same way but again as we're seeing throughout these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:46,hearings and I'm glad we're doing these quarterly again is that there needs to be a a large scale coordination of these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:06:53,efforts again I applaud your efforts in trying to map this all out I feel like it's duplicative of task force it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:01,duplicative of the blight map and the crime map um and so again if we could just get in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:07,a room and like hammer out processes I think that that would go a long way but I do like the idea of embedding somebody,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:14,in the districts I think it would be helpful for my purposes to have an ADA come out it's neighborhood association,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:20,meetings so that they can answer the hard questions that I get about certain,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:25,crimes certain prosecutions why things happen why things don't happen so again I applaud that effort I just want to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:30,make sure that we're coordinated going forward in all of our efforts to solve blight uh and and all the things that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:38,contribute to Crime absolutely that the the siloing of efforts is one of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:43,most frustrating things I've ever encountered in my time as a prosecutor I've done this for 13 years and a lot of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:49,that was done on the opioid level trying to bring together disparate elements so we're all focusing on the same problem,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:07:56,but weren't sharing data we have the same problem with mental health where we have mental health responses but we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:01,not able to share data out of respect for privacy out of respect for HIPAA but that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:07,prevents you know my office let's say I'm making a screening decision and I want to take into a fact that someone is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:12,suffering from a behavioral health issue well I'm I'm perturbed in that effort because defense counsel obviously,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:18,doesn't want us to be retaliatory or somehow hold it against a particular defendant that they're suffering from,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:23,mental health issue and thereby advocate for a stiffer or a worse penalty because they're a dangerous wheel that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:29,weren't going to respond to in that way and even if I in good faith say that's not what I'm trying to do I'm trying to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:35,understand that they are diminished culpability because of their behavioral health issue there are fundamental,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:40,barriers between the two sides of the aisle with respect to the sharing of his data and it's an extremely frustrating,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:45,thing as someone who's trying to seek justice but not but not being able to do so because I don't have all the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:51,information so one of the things we're doing with this particular effort is partnering with Dr Joel Kaplan from,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:08:56,Rutgers University who pioneered this wrist terrain mapping effect we're having a um a symposium I believe it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:03,on March 15th at my office which will be inviting multiple members to to try to coordinate this effort but the data sets,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:09,we're using we're not crafting on our own you know part of this effort is to coordinate with what's already happening,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:15,in the nopd analytics division to share that data and use it to populate our data set we're also making uh efforts to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:22,share our data set with the LSP Fusion Center and with other uh data amalgamators like the Haida program that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:28,can help share these data sets because holding on to data and sitting on it and not sharing it is anathema to making,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:35,coordinated efforts and you're exactly right but those silos are a bulwark in and of themselves the crime is its own,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:41,problem the siloing of our efforts is its own separate problem that is almost as worse yeah I mean listen I think the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:46,siloing should be up there the D siloing needs to be up there is one of our efforts our joint efforts to deter crime,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:09:53,because obviously the criminals know that we're siled and that we're not sharing information and so they know where the hot spots are and that we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:10:00,not getting to fundamental issues like blight like lighting like streets like all of the things that cause criminality,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:10:06,to happen and again we've identified these we know where they are so it's just a matter of getting resources to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:10:12,prevent them like get a block lit up so that we can make sure that uh criminal activity does not occur in that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:10:18,particular spot so thank you again for identifying it and you can hear the frustration in my voice because I say it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:10:23,over and over again because councilmember Harris for you uh in a uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:10:40,and management coordination is something that has to be looked at and uh it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:10:46,should be extremely important so I'm hoping that the other partners the stakeholders are listening saying oh we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:10:52,want to do that too and somebody will reach out and they'll have some uh conversation and some coordination but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:13:46,Priceless opportunity recently to sit with President Ross from the ABA she came by our office and sat down with our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:14:06,projects in a collaborative way right to prevent that that Silo and that council members Harrison Thomas have been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:12,talking about today we also spoke to her about um you know appealing more in the equity,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:17,space and making sure that we are hiring a diverse staff of people from Adas and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:23,support staff so we have taken a number of those different recommendations to heart and are actively implementing that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:30,as we speak um this last slide is really a quick you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:37,know thank you to the council right I've heard other organizations today talk about how important Investments have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:14:49,about Alternatives that you know where we can create a a unique specialized,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:55,plan for somebody who finds a way uh into our office uh the investment that you guys made in uh Youth Services is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:15:03,invaluable uh I heard the first presentation you guys spoke a little bit about the resolution that was passed at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:15:09,the last meeting um that access to the South White entrance is is no small thing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:15:15,um it is absolutely critical to not have victims and Witnesses who are already in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:15:20,an uneasy space in a vulnerable position to have to go through additional hurdles in order to get to court we're relying,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:15:27,on creating as comfortable an environment and as you know Cooperative an environment as possible for those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:15:33,folks whenever they get into the courtroom so the ability to have swipe card access at that door,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:15:39,um you know we've got post certified uh officers who act as investigators we've got nopd Personnel embedded in our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:15:45,office who at all times are making sure that not only are we secure but the people who we are walking into that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:15:52,Courthouse are are secure and they're abiding by all rules so we have complete,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:15:57,confidence that um if given if we get given getting that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:16:02,access back because the office once had that swipe card access a limited number of cards were provided to us and we had,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:16:10,always both honored and respected the protocols that were set around the courthouse so uh the ability and and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:16:17,Prospects of getting that back are going to be huge for our operations and uh the cooperation that we received from from,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:16:23,victims and Witnesses and thank you all for the opportunity thank you any council members,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:16:29,councilmember Morrell thank you just on that last point I'm sure you were here,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:16:34,for the CDC judge presentation and like I said it I remain disappointed by,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:16:41,the substantial amount of miscommunication because I believe that from the council's perspective from the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:16:47,DA's perspective from our communication with the judges the whole effort to have a camera installed was to circumvent the problem,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:16:54,that has been repeatedly created by the Sheriff's Office not providing individual to staff the South White,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:17:01,entrance and I really think it would be important to explain to the people who,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:17:07,are watching how far away the alternative entrance is because it is actually further from the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:17:14,DA's office than the front entrance correct yes sir can you kind of give a geographic breakdown as of where that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:17:20,alternative juror entrance is Andrew talk to us a little bit about the Broad Street yeah yes so uh to walk the Tulane,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:17:28,and Broad courthouse is immense as you probably know it's an old Battleship building built uh over 100 years ago I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:17:35,believe at this point and to get from one side to the other you have to expose yourself all the way down to Lane Avenue past the main entrance which is up,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:17:41,several flights of stairs all the way to the other side facing the broad entrance uh that is an immense walk in broad,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:17:48,daylight exposing our victims to an area and of high traffic where we'd really have no control over that situation for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:17:55,safety purposes and we're also unfortunately schlepping massive files and documents through there through the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:18:01,wind rain and sleet all the way around to that one side just to get in so it is a it is a heavy lift to try to get there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:18:07,and as a heavy lift back after done with court for a long day yes in darkness in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:18:12,a place that uh you know is not um not our favorite neighborhood I don't think you'd want to sleep there on the corner,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:18:18,if you had a choice I think it's important to note that both for the safety of D.A Ada's the D.A,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:18:25,and their Witnesses those individuals who would like to deter a DA or a witness from going into,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:18:31,the courthouse would have plenty of opportunity to do so if they're having to walk pretty much a one and a half city blocks,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:18:39,to the interest that has been designated as the D.A entrance correct past the bus stop or anyone who could sitting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:18:44,legitimately or otherwise be there just waiting for me to walk by that's okay I think it's important,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:18:50,like I said there there's been significant miscommunication on this issue I I want to especially point out,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:18:56,that the judicial administrator said he hadn't received nothing I will double check with our staff but I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:03,do believe the judges were sent a copy of the resolution you signed a resolution 2351 specifically around this issue it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:10,the fact we were told that they had received nothing on it and that they've been nuclear communication,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:15,was especially disheartening because I know that myself and other people I'd spoken to a variety of judges on this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:21,topic and I remain concerned that the judges make decisions on Bonk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:27,that any ability to correct this problem is now pushed back even farther because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:33,now they have to have an unboxed meeting to look at what their position is going to be so it's basically you have a lot,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:39,of Chiefs in the kitchen and I don't see this issue being solved in the near future and it's very concerning to me,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:46,and it's especially highlight because I do think it's important and I've mentioned this to the council vice,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:52,president multiple occasions the City of New Orleans spends a tremendous amount of money subsidizing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:19:58,Criminal Court in our Criminal Justice System more than any other city in the state of Louisiana because we have a two,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:04,clerk system and as I repeatedly tell people we are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:11,in a very unique and tenuous situation in that our criminal Criminal Court receives a six million dollar direct,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:18,appropriation from the state that can be withdrawn at any time because no other court in the state of Louisiana it's a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:26,direct State appropriation at all and it's not necessary in any other jurisdiction because when civil court,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:32,and Criminal Court are similarly singularly situated the more robust,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:38,civil court pays for the criminal court so just like right now I know I'm going,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:43,to anger a whole lot of civil court judges there's a reason why they sit on a surplus each year and many other,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:48,courts do not because the Civil side of a traditional court system funds the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:20:54,criminal side whereas in hours because it's just a civil side they reap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:00,significant surpluses each year and in that alternative the state and the city,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:05,step in to subsidize Criminal Court rather than the courts funding,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:10,themselves with their own resources now I understand that we are going to have a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:16,two clerk system for the foreseeable future but I do think it's important to have more communication between civil,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:23,court and Criminal Court to figure out how they can help solve this problem because it is unique to New Orleans,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:30,all that being said if as a city we're going to be put in the unique position,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:35,to having to subsidize criminal court at this magnitude which no other city does,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:42,there needs to be much more clear and concise and respectful conversations,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:47,regarding issues like the South White instruments because it's a problem we've been talking about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:53,this problem since last year and my frustration with government in general,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:21:58,is when everyone says why they can't solve a problem versus coming up with the solution at this point we've got a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:22:06,three-man firing squad shooting each other between the DA's office the Sheriff's Office and the judges,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:22:13,and the group that is most exposed in this in this three-man firing squad is the victims and the witnesses who are in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:22:44,morale is focused on today we should be worshiping victims and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:22:49,Witnesses it's difficult enough to come down to or to take risks to be exposed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:22:56,as they do but we have so many people who are committed to our city to making our city a better City that they do for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:04,free but a lot of people can't imagine them doing and that's serving us victims and witnesses to crimes so you know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:11,whatever we can do council member Morrell I certainly look forward to being able to report at the next meeting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:16,that this has been worked out I mean I can't believe I thought that everything had been worked out honestly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:21,I'm not faulting you all but victims and Witnesses have to be treated with the utmost,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:27,respect because without them my system doesn't work it's difficult enough for the system to work but to put,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:33,pressure on them is kind of ridiculous but okay I have a question for you all and it's in the spirit of trying to get,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:39,things done but it's a little bit critical of facts the Metropolitan crime commission reports that the New Orleans,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:45,Police Department the gold standard for policing in our country as far as the district attorney has said made 3 900,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:54,on the arrest last year felony arrested that's a that's what so so many per day,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:23:59,but at the end of that 3 900 I'll give you an example of 1900 with violent,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:06,felonies some of those were weapons so anybody who's arrested for the most part there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:12,are exceptions with a weapon because of a weapons violation has that weapon on them so just as the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:18,professional members of our New Orleans Police Department made arrest over the Bayou Classic weekend 60 of them in just,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:24,the French Quarter alone they take a risk doing that it's got to be frustrating to police officers to know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:31,that of 2900 screened cases,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:36,1500 were accepted one out of two you can even say one out of two was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:42,accepted or one out of two was rejected but it's a very challenging statistic I'm going,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:48,to be productive and I'm going to ask you all to explain what we can do to enhance that profile or that number,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:24:57,but if I'm someone who's engaged in felony violent criminal activity and I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:03,look at these numbers and I see 1900 arrests made in 2022 for violent,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:08,felonies but I only see 93 guilty as charged,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:13,because of many of them were dismissed I see 301 guilty of lesser felony,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:19,charges and then those felonies violent felonies turned into misdemeanors in 303 cases,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:26,I'm going to be as upbeat as I can to just ask for your assistance in letting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:31,us know what can be done to make these numbers better because if I were a member of the New Orleans Police,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:37,Department putting my life on the line making an arrest of someone who had a gun,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:42,a juvenile or an adult some adult who has made it clear that he doesn't intend to go,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:48,um quietly and one out of two cases was dismissed and only 93 out of 1900 were,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:25:55,found guilty as charged I'd be very concerned so I'm going to ask you all as the four important representatives of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:01,the DA's office only the D.A himself being present could be you know in a position to answer more than you all can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:07,answer what can be done to enhance those numbers 1900 violent felony arrest,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:15,again not to be labeled a fact but such a small percentage of guilty as charged,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:21,and then brought down to misdemeanors guilty is charged 93 guilty of lesser,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:26,felonies 301 guilty of misdemeanors so from felonies to misdemeanors,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:33,um 303. what can we do as a society what can we do working with your office to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:38,enhance those numbers to help keep our citizens safer so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:44,unpack that question because there's a couple different responses that are appropriate the first is our acceptance,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:51,rate you know the numbers that we have uh don't line up exactly what you presented,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:26:56,today but I will say that it is difficult to move forward on arrests that are based solely on witness,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:27:01,testimony particularly when those Witnesses later on turn out to either not want to come in and cooperate with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:27:07,the system because they're scared of retaliation or they just simply don't want to be bothered with it or they choose not to trust members of the law,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:27:14,enforcement or criminal justice Community who are trying to resolve those cases so those can be significantly challenging across the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:27:21,board when we face those those kind of odds also I think your numbers probably include a lot of our domestic violence,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:27:27,cases those cases as well have highly highly volatile victims who can be somewhat difficult to deal with on a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:27:34,repeated basis these are Affairs of the heart and those victims often recant or change their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:27:40,story or decide they don't choose to prosecute and come in and request drop forms those are also very difficult for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:27:46,us we have tools we can use to try to see through that to try to proceed anyway but those tools are also somewhat,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:27:51,limited by the constraints that we face as practitioners of criminal justice under the Constitution,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:27:57,so with those two put it aside then we're talking about how do we focus on the guns and I would like to respond to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:28:03,that particularly because I think that's kind of what you're focusing in on is that fair the Firearms yeah well that's 368 cases,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:28:12,where the New Orleans Police Department made arrest of persons who had illegal,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:28:17,guns or who would discharge them illegally so in general yes you can address that it's more about just,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:28:23,violent crimes in general violent crimes yeah so violent crimes in general low percentage of solve rate yeah the the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:28:29,DA's office will prosecute and file charges on every single viable case that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:28:34,we have before so that we can possibly get we are tenacious and trying to pursue every single lead to uncover,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:28:41,every single piece of evidence that might be left off we call it the grind and when we get a case that involves a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:28:46,crime of violence particularly a gun crime of violence we grind at those cases trying to determine whether or not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:28:52,there's any way with whatever evidence we've been presented by an OPD and whatever testimonial evidence we can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:28:57,recover from those Witnesses we can grind through and find a way to prosecute those cases so I I don't have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:29:03,an individualized case to present you that points this case out points out what your we were getting to but I will,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:29:10,say that every single case we can prosecute we are Prosecuting with respect to the guns themselves there are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:29:16,some things that we're hoping to do and do differently with respect to how we handle Firearms cases and one of those things is something that Keith mentioned,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:29:22,with regard to our private Partnerships we're trying to speed up the velocity with which we prosecute and file charges,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:29:29,on these gun offenses I think one of the things that always accrues to the benefit of the defendant,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:29:36,of these defendants who are arrested is the delay in time between the screening of the case the arraignment of the case,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:29:42,and the trial of the case and if we can speed up the velocity of that those cases in particular those gun cases,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:29:48,those gun crimes of violence and even those gun gun possession cases where somebody is unlawfully in possession of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:29:54,a firearm for example a 95-1 felon with a firearm or a 95e the possession of a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:29:59,firearm while in the possession of a controlled dangerous substance or during a crime of violence or even a 95a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:30:04,carrying of a concealed weapon I think if we can speed up the velocity City and attack those gun cases hard we would be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:30:10,able to proceed more quickly and that's one of the things that we're trying to do right now in those private Partnerships is rocket dock at these gun,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:30:18,charges as quickly as possible and get them as quickly as possible into a arraignment and trial posture now one of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:30:24,the other aspects um that can be difficult is with firearm cases you know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:30:30,there are a segment of them that are completely based upon the testimony of the law enforcement officers who make,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:30:36,them and they're typically recorded on body worn camera and we can speed through those very very quickly which is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:30:42,why we have the option to use these private Partnerships to speed up that velocity the cases that are based upon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:30:47,the testimony of witnesses the cases that are always based upon the human element those can be more difficult to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:30:53,speed up so I really want to focus on the ones that we can make Headway on and those are the 95 ones the 95es and the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:31:00,95 A's there is a tremendous amount of guns on the streets of New Orleans,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:31:05,it's no surprise when we've had a astronomical increase in the sale of firearms for legitimate local gun stores,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:31:11,throughout this past two or three years of the pandemic where we've seen these numbers just Skyrocket and if you talk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:31:17,about just a small percentage of those cases of those guns being left in automobiles,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:31:23,that are being subject to simple burglaries over and over again then you're talking about an exponential growth number of firearms in the hands,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:31:30,of people who should not have them so I do want to focus uh with laser-like,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:31:35,intensity upon these firearms and see if we can increase the speed with which we handle them which we screen them and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:31:42,with which we get them to trial just all violent felony cases then let's spoke let's talk on about the solutions,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:31:49,you're focused what can we do or what can state law do to expedite that process between arrest,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:31:57,and arraignment I mean that is a very serious concern I mean a lot happens in the meantime that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:32:03,wouldn't happen if there was a more expedited process so not to focus so much on guns because guns is just one,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:32:10,aspect of the reason that we have such a violent crime where we have a violent crime rate amongst people who use knives,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:32:15,at the end of the day arrest an arraignment if that's one solution is that a law that this Council needs to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:32:22,support with a resolution a state law or what's taking so long,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:32:27,with respect to the laws in the books I believe the laws and the books are adequate I don't think that there is a requirement that there be a new,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:32:32,ordinance or a new law passed in order to enable us to Pro proactively go after,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:32:37,these types of crimes but I do believe that it's a question of resources nopd needs resources to make these cases the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:32:44,DA's office needs resources in order to screen them quickly that's one of the reasons I am promoting this kind of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:32:49,reorganization to limit the number of districts I'm sorry to redistribute the screeners to on a district level so that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:32:55,we can focus on those patterns of crime and try to understand them more efficiently and then also process them,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:33:01,more efficiently so those are one of the that's one of the solutions we're trying right now and we're hiring for right now,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:33:06,to put in place to focus on that issue but when you say resources I think that you'll agree just as we mentioned that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:33:11,the council has been very supportive in providing resources absolutely homicide for Juvenile Justice intervention and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:33:18,then the police officers when the police department asked for the administration we didn't cut you know we may have cut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:33:24,positions in terms of they want are going to be filled but what resources do we need is it more,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:33:32,people or is it more money to do this between arrest and arraignment if it's a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:33:37,resource issue how can it be addressed I think that the public wants to know we really want to support whatever the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:33:43,efforts are especially with the D.A and the police but what resources are there yeah and if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:33:49,you don't have the answer to that you can give me a number and the council is going to be very open to it but I mean I'm just saying we hear a lot that it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:33:56,a resources issue if it's a Personnel issue I fully understand because I don't know where everybody is if you don't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:01,have people working in jobs um building jobs we have thousands of vacancies within our city of New Orleans,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:07,but whatever other resources there are but we've been very generous it is the human resource that I'm talking about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:12,that is absolutely right it is difficult to fill jobs we are trying with this District screener position to fund it at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:19,a higher rate the range of pay is 80 to 100 000 we're looking for experienced prosecutors who have seen a thing or two,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:26,in the trial division who have tried a case who have an idea of what the uh what the defense will be trying as far,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:32,as his tactics so they can prepare for those and iron clady's cases that we're receiving from nopd so filling those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:39,positions is my challenge right now but I think that increasing the salaries and getting competitive salaries with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:45,neighboring districts is a neighboring parishes is an important part of what we do to draw in the human resource element,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:50,that we so vitally need it's not a problem unfortunately unique to The Orleans Parish DA's office our sister,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:56,parishes around the state are also experiencing the same difficulty filling positions they've got to ask us if if we need to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:03,pay somebody and we could get an increase or a decrease in the amount of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:08,time between arrest and arraignment and it took us another 250 000 if we'd find it because it's all about keeping us,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:14,safe keeping the public safe which is the most important thing absolutely I have just um something very important to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:35:26,Orleans Police Department and the reports that you get and as you answer I'm going to ask you to be reminded of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:32,this or comment on it it's my understanding that there's an assistant D.A who can work with every District in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:39,terms of police reports because we shouldn't be having a problem with the police reporting right the actual,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:45,contents of the report when I see one out of two cases rejected I would imagine that that's got to be a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:53,relatively small number based on the actual reports themselves because you all can intervene in those reports am I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:59,right intervene in the reports well if the report comes to you and it doesn't have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:36:06,all the information in it that you need you have the ability to go back to the the officer who writes the report or the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:36:13,commander and say no this isn't going to work you need to bring us a little bit more and if you can't bring us a little,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:36:18,bit more then we'll have to reject it but you do have the opportunity to go back to offices through your assistant,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:36:24,D.A one who is assigned to each district and tell them what you need is that working well that's what we're trying to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:36:31,do right now is it working is it working this is the program that I'm describing us rolling out as we speak the a-cased,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:36:37,officers are our primary points of contact with each of the nopd police districts it is their responsibility to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:36:43,collect and gather and facilitate training for the lower uh the patrolmen and the other individuals detectives who,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:36:48,are in that District collect that information and share it with us digitally so when there are deficiencies we are communicating those back through,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:36:55,our refusal Code system for the reason for the basis for the refusal so that information is flowing back down mail,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:01,one of the reasons I want to switch to this District model this District screening model is so there is a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:06,singular point of contact so if there is a training deficiency if there's an issue with a particular type of case,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:11,where we could use a little bit more or need something differently done at the time of the arrest or at the time of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:17,arrival on scene we can facilitate helping with training we can communicate with nlpd's training structure and help,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:24,put on trainings at a district level so that we can correct that issue proactively that was part of the issue,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:29,that I'm trying to circumventize that we have on our blinders and we see a bad case and we don't connect it to 08 there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:34,seems to be an issue in this particular Police District with a particular style of case and we can do something about it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:39,so now by being observant and now having a district screening assignment we can make those observations we can make,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:46,those conclusions and then we can work with the district commanders to help correct that issue and hopefully increase that acceptance rate so can you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:52,tell members of the public that the police department the members of the police department are writing good reports if the report has information or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:59,needs additional information that that you're able to go back to them to get that additional information so that it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:04,not a police report that stops a prosecution I'm absolutely able to represent that I have a screening,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:10,division we're able to communicate very effectively with our a case officers and if there's a deficiency we communicated and if it's possible to be corrected it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:17,will be corrected I'd like to congratulate the members of our Police Department because there's too many rumors out there that prosecutions don't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:22,happen because police don't provide the information that they need in a report at the end of the day you can always go,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:28,back to them and get additional information and our officers are willing to go back many times to the scene of the crime to talk to to talk to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:35,witnesses to get that additional information you do not reject a number of a large number of cases based on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:41,insufficient information in the report right not based upon the willingness of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:46,the police officer to try to follow up certainly I am in my 13 years as a prosecutor I am very impressed with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:53,increase in the quality uh and the worksmanship of the police reporting process throughout the time that I've,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:58,been as a prosecutor there are unfortunately those certain circumstances where the work needed to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:03,be done at that moment in that space in that particular time when that police officer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:09,arrived on scene or in that particular moment when they were taking that statement and those are things we simply can't go back in time and correct in all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:15,areas that's why it's so important to coordinate and communicate with the nlpd district commanders that if there is a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:21,training deficiency we can collectively identify it and we can collectively remedy it but you can go back and get,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:26,additional statements from that same Witness yes we certainly can if it's a if that's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:32,the issue you can go back and search for additional evidence including in the apartment where the crime might have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:37,taken place we hope that we can do that unfortunately whenever we leave a crime,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:42,scene it's no longer preserved and secure and so any Police Department uh any remember the police department will,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:48,tell you that when we leave that crime scene and we even exposed members of the public or other potential criminals that we now lose the effectiveness of that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:56,particular evidence even if we go back later on and try to collect it that it might be compromised in a way that it loses its efficacy at trial later on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:40:03,okay thank you very much um for your time and I appreciate the work that you all do whatever we can do to increase,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:48:36,the last few months we're able to turn that into analysis which is used in these presentations,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:48:42,um we are able to track where the applicants are coming from so we can say 65 percent of applicants are coming from,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:48:48,out of state compared to prior to the announcement 50 um to just throw numbers out there so uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:48:54,very pleased with the information coming from Civil Service uh nopd also very pleased with the data and the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:49:01,relationship that we have nopd obviously has a wide variety of data sets that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:49:06,they produce in the the already produced publicly specifically 9-1-1 calls for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:49:11,service electronic police reports they have uh the other aspect of the police Staffing dashboard is that every week,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:49:17,they update their numbers so we're able to track over time how many officers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:49:22,they have how many recruits they have I believe a recruit class of 19 just started that hasn't quite hit their data,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:49:28,yet but once it does we'll update it and you'll see a slight uptick in the number of officers and recruits,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:49:33,um we also are working with them this was our first joint product a the historical,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:49:39,murder dashboard one of the things that the data ordinance requested was for nopd to provide,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:49:45,data on homicides and so you can see that uh we're working with them they're providing on a monthly basis their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:49:52,spreadsheet that they keep track of where they're tracking all murders and this does a couple of things one it allows us to produce a product like this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:49:59,which sits both on the council website and on the nopd website it also allows us to know in real time how many murders,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:06,there were Neo real time it doesn't sound like much but we've,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:12,gone months years even where there's very little actual hard information on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:18,just how many of the worst crime in the city has happened and now we're able to say month to month how many victims,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:24,there have been with eight you know information on the demographics age the weapons used things like that and we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:30,able to push that out to the public which allows for Less uncertainty it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:35,allows for a better understanding of what's happening what the trends look like and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:40,um I think that this is useful both for people that just want to stay up to date it's useful for researchers it's useful,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:45,for journalists and it's useful for me myself a data analyst who just wants to be able to follow things nopd has also,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:54,produced data on facial recognition they're producing that data quarterly so just a couple weeks ago we got the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:51:00,fourth quarter data from facial recognition we're able to turn around a very quick analysis and send that to all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:51:05,of you council members on use of facial recognition or I guess non-use mostly facial recognition in the fourth quarter,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:51:11,of 2022 that's the type of thing that I think will be most useful when we look,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:51:16,back in October of this year and we have a full year of data and can actually provide that so very useful to be able,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:51:22,to have that data um if I did miss any data sets you know certainly ask about them and I'm happy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:51:29,to say whether or not an OPD is providing them um the Sheriff's Office continues to provide data access to their Data,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:51:35,Systems which allows for the jail dashboard it allows for um pretty much all of the dashboards to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:51:41,be honest to function um the our work through the the Sheriff's Office allows access to the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:51:46,court data so we're able to see what's happening within the criminal court um unfortunately we still don't have any,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:51:53,access to municipal or traffic court data but when we have requested that data they've been more than willing to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:51:59,provide it it's just that we don't sort of proactively have access to it in ways that we have for other,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:52:05,sources um the District Attorney's Office you know full disclosure we do have a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:52:11,Consulting relationship with the District Attorney's office as well have access to their data through that means,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:52:16,um the there's not many circumstances where the court data and the DA's data,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:52:23,we can usually get what we need through the court so I can't think of any circumstances where we've needed to have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:52:28,access to something from the DA's office that we haven't been able to access through the court data,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:52:34,um the good example being when when the 701s popped up as an issue about a year ago we were able through the court to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:52:41,analyze it and respond to your questions using just the court data not relying on the DA's data at the time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:52:48,um and then the juvenile court being the last one which I think is the most challenging for us just because until,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:52:54,the end of 2021 the juvenile court was using a system um and they switched to a new system,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:53:01,through digicort which is also what I believe uh trafficking Municipal Court are using and you can access all the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:53:08,data you can a kid gets arrested the the use you know somebody juvenile court can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:53:13,type up the name see all the cases they've been involved in see uh with this this case status is from our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:53:19,perspective as data analysts though we can't export the data so through from,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:53:24,2012 through 2021 we were able to export data and make things like when we wanted to analyze what share of arrest,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:53:30,city-wide were juveniles what share of vehicle burglaries are being committed by juveniles or vehicle burglary arrests,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:53:36,are being committed by juveniles um we were able to do that until the start of 2022 now what we're able to do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:53:44,is basically we have to download it we we do a full month month or a full year we're able to isolate just the item,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:53:50,numbers and so we can do a little bit of analysis by just finding what the item numbers are and so I can tell you whether or not a case was an adult or a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:53:58,juvenile arrest through additional analysis but we can't do things like track juvenile arrests over time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:54:05,um how it compares to adult arrests or another thing that we're able to do is we were able to tell how many juveniles,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:54:11,were incarcerated in any one day from I believe 2014 or 2015 through the end of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:54:16,2021 we're no longer able to do that systemically I believe through their program that you can do if I wanted to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:54:23,check today I could see that but I can't go back and see December 6 2022 how many people were in cars how many juveniles,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:54:29,were incarcerated so from our end it is problematic it hasn't been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:54:35,um the biggest issue just because there hasn't been any major issue that we've tried to analyze but it is sort of a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:54:41,black hole if we were asked to analyze a specific issue related to juvenile arrests or juvenile incarceration we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:54:48,would struggle to be able to analyze that from the available data right now uh I think before I yield to the council,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:54:53,vice president for some questions I think that what's very interesting is and this is probably an over uh probably,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:55:00,something that Council overlooked we operate it with the assumptions as the city is funding all these respective,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:55:06,courts that we're operating off a unified system and I think it's important to note that many of our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:55:13,partners at least operate on systems that to a large degree communicate with each,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:55:18,other so the challenge you're having with two different groups which Municipal and traffic court as one group,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:55:23,and juvenile court is that they operate on a different system that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:55:29,does not really allow for the export exporting data for analysis now one bit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:55:34,Municipal and traffic get on their current system that is similar to juvenile court that I don't know I think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:55:39,they've been on it for years um certainly as long as I've been working with the council as a consultant,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:55:45,I I think it's kind of a missed opportunity because we had a similar issue during budget we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:55:51,have the sheriff's office here and there was an effort as we were trying to put like the the final touch on the unified,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:55:59,system of our criminal justice Partners where I think the sheriff proposed going to a whole different system and the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:56:05,council pretty definitively push back on that saying that as a city of New Orleans if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:56:11,we're going to fund these these systems that process and collect data they have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:56:17,to be the goal is to try and have everyone on the same system for a variety of reasons one is obviously for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:56:23,the for exporting and collecting data and the aggregate so we can analyze and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:56:28,have accountability but on the other hand when you have multiple systems that means you have to have multiple contracts for individuals to maintain,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:56:36,and operate those systems which is another problem with lacking uniformity so I think something will have to work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:56:43,off work on offline Jeff is maybe revisiting the data ordinance to require everyone to be on exportable systems,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:56:50,because I think that is going to be increasingly problematic that as the other agencies provide the data that you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:56:57,request I think it's going to be challenging to parse data if it's not set an exportable,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:57:02,format and that will delay our ability to respond to the public or media,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:57:08,regarding a quest request for certain data Council vice president,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:57:14,thank you Mr President um Jeff for the for the ones where the data,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:57:19,can't be exported can't these agencies just give you just direct access would,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:57:24,that be a helpful way uh I'm not sure we haven't really explored that with juvenile court,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:57:30,um the I'm not sure how their data is stored or if there's a way to receive sort of that back-end access in ways,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:57:37,that we have through other means um it's I guess possible but yeah it didn't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:57:44,used to be an issue so there was never any reason to explore it because under the old system sure just select the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:57:50,dates export it analyze it yeah well to the president's point it's like we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:57:56,need to figure out a path for you to be able to get the data that you need to be able to do the correct type of analytics,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:58:01,and if we need to revisit the data ordinance we'll do so you briefly mentioned in your presentation uh Jeff,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:58:08,something that piqued my interest you talked about the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:58:13,fourth quarter report for facial recognition now the the facial recognition technology is something that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:58:20,is recently being utilized by uh the nopd what are the initial uh reports,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:58:27,showing you what kind of start is it off to uh so from the data that we received,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:58:32,from nopd we saw that there were six requests for facial recognition in the fourth quarter so it was October through,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:58:38,December 2022 um of those six requests I believe and I don't have the the spreadsheet in front,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:58:45,of me um I believe that there were three matches and one of those matches was an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:58:52,incorrect match that nopd was able to through their process to their credit was able to identify that the match was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:58:58,incorrect um so they had two matches and I believe of those they're still investigating all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:59:04,of them so they have no arrests as of I don't know exactly when the data was produced and sent but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:59:11,um right now my understanding is that there's zero rest from those so uh you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:59:17,know reasonably light I guess usage of the facial recognition so far no hits but I think again we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:59:24,talking about having three months of actual data and so it's hard to say whether officers are are just slow to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:59:31,adopt it whether or not they're going to adopt it more whether or not they're gonna use it for a wider variety of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:59:37,incidents or become better accustomed to which incidents they can put forward yeah really hard to say it's something,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:59:43,that that as an analyst we look forward to being able to Monitor and be able to draw more firm conclusions I would hate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:59:48,to jump to any firm conclusion based on just three months of data but that's what we've seen so far yeah yeah no,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:59:54,doubt and and I you know I agree with you that it's like what we'll keep taking a look at what's what's happening,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:59:59,but um you know certainly when um you know when we look back at the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:00:05,real push to have this technology out there that it was um something you know really touted as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:00:11,the the big kind of crime-solving tool but just in these initial um results,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:00:17,you know with six requests um leading to zero uh arrests three,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:00:23,matches and one of the matches being wrong I mean it seems like it's off to a little bit of a of a rocky start so you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:00:30,know kind of with that um being said it's it's sure it's important to have tools in the toolbox,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:00:36,but we can't put all our eggs in one one basket and and that's why I think it's so important to continue other you know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:00:43,means of investigative policing and work on the whole thing that we've been talking about we're really Reinventing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:00:48,and reimagining uh how we do policing in the city and and all the different pieces of deployment and and adding,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:00:55,civilians and all those different things that it isn't just one piece of technology that's gonna be the be the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:01:00,the one thing that that deals with all the problems but keep us posted on the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:01:05,next round and if you want to do any further analysis on those individual ones let us know also where all the all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:01:11,the correct protocols followed as far as like notification that the technology is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:01:16,going to be utilized where all the proper steps taken uh I don't have a ton of insight into,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:01:22,their process I know that there might have been some issues with the the means,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:01:35,um you know uh my understanding from the available data is that there was Counseling in a few incidents where,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:01:41,perhaps the wrong order in which in in item number was submitted up for facial,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:01:47,recognition um but I I don't think that it was a problem Beyond again we're just talking,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:01:53,about six incidents so we don't know whether or not it'll be a widespread problem or if it's something that it's just adoption of a new technique and new,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:01:59,technology and the officers just need to learn exactly what to do from a process standpoint got it got it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:02:06,um if you could um get some of that information to the full Council and writing Jeff that would be helpful also,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:02:34,um of their reporting and were able to analyze that and we're working on a rtcc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:02:45,council councilmember Greene I like to tout the statistic relative to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:02:52,facial recognition and make one thing clear I was the author of The along with two co-sponsors of the of the ordinance,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:02:59,that made access to facial recognition available but it was access to use the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:03:05,technology it's important to recognize that the numbers should be low because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:03:10,it's only in cases of violent crimes and it's only as a last resort,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:03:17,many of the criminals in our city make it easy to identify because they do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:03:22,crimes in front of people they do crimes in front of cameras they walk and tout themselves in front of a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:03:27,camera in front of a store and you don't really need facial recognition for that witnesses will call,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:03:33,you all the time the very the very fact that we have six in a quarter and no,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:03:39,prosecutions have resulted for that to my in my opinion and it's also a fact,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:03:45,lures that concern that we sometimes had or some members had relative to the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:03:52,police abusing the technology six times no prosecutions based on that again it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:03:58,a last resort we also have safeguards in place that council members through their amendments put in place such that there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:04:05,are a couple of people who look at it's not just one officer who makes a decision in the street it's a supervisor,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:04:10,who's had an opportunity to take a look at all of the facts those numbers should be low but they're partially low because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:04:17,of the fact that if it's going to be a last resort in violent crimes only you don't really need it that much so I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:04:24,think that some of the concerns that we had relative to its use and it being abused by the police are being,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:04:31,allayed by the fact that it's not being abused by police it's six times and it's not one usage in court to make a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:04:40,prosecution that is a great statistic on the part of the police department I appreciate them for their continuity,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:04:46,continuing concerns relative to constitutional rights but again Last Resort violent crimes only and as a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:04:54,technologist being used by every Police Department in the metropolitan area and in the state all we have is access to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:05:01,the technology we don't even generate it so I think that it's a good news story that those numbers are low and the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:05:07,bottom line is that if it solves one crime in 2023 or Beyond,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:05:13,then it was worth the investment in the legislation and I would add that I believe four of the incidents were armed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:05:19,robberies and two were non-fatal shootings so to your point it is all violent crime violent crime um and as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:05:25,the data analyst I'm appreciative of the fact that one it the data is being collected by nopd and to the data is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:05:31,being then reported and provided to us so that it can become something that is not just a secret sauce that nobody has,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:05:38,any insight to I think that those are very good additions to uh the Technologies use,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:05:43,I think that gives us the opportunity too that if you know there are glitches Jeff that we can work through those like,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:31:37,police intake Specialists for our alternative police Response Unit Prime,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:43,lab analysis social workers and other administrative positions so what that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:48,means is we are beefing up our civilian staff um we're um really pushing to um hire,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:56,those 25 people who are um intake Specialists that are going to man our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:32:01,alternative police Response Unit we think is very important um that we uh staff that particular unit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:32:10,because it does a couple of things it um takes a burden off of our citizens for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:32:15,waiting around for reports that can be taken all over the phone or online time and they have don't have to wait around,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:32:21,for a police to show up at their home or business and it also allows officers on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:32:27,the street not to be able have to handle those particular calls and they can respond,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:32:33,um to more urgent calls and it drives our response times down and I think we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:32:38,that is definitely a goal of mine to make sure that we are answering calls in a timely fashion,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:32:45,um driving those um numbers down and I think civilianizing um a great bit of our department is a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:32:52,big assistance to officers and is a gift to um our citizens and they deserve to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:32:58,um have the police in a timely fashion so I think um the big push to do that I think it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:33:03,working um and we have had input from account council members we've had input from the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:33:10,federal monitors um and everyone uh different people in the community so we have everybody on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:33:16,board for that and I think we're gonna um we're gonna do great with so civilianizing a good bit of our uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:33:23,Department uh our current sworn strength is um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:33:29,922 commissions officers and 223 civilians we have lost 12-1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:33:37,personnel and six civilian civilians thus far this year and I just want to say that the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:33:43,department is committed absolutely committed I am committed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:33:48,to reducing violent crime in this city and demanding Public Safety,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:33:53,um we strive um to bring an end to um all the violence um all the killing um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:33:59,you know all the um really really violent um crimes in our city,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:05,and our goal is to provide a quality of life that the people of New Orleans,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:11,expect and they absolutely um deserve I appreciate your time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:17,um and allowing me to make this presentation and I have if you have any,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:23,questions come here to answer my Moreno,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:28,thank you Mr chair and good afternoon to to you all I have to say I I really like what I'm seeing at this table,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:36,and listen look all women um law enforcement a career at the nopd,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:43,is for for women as well absolutely and you all are that very uh visual group,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:50,that I think can likely lead to other women saying you know what that's a profession that likely could be for me,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:55,absolutely and as you mentioned you know maybe not necessarily as a commissioned officer but one of the civilian,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:35:00,employees who could be helpful with uh with still crime fighting at the nopd so I appreciate seeing this table,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:35:07,so a few things one um thank you for the plan and uh you know not not an issue,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:35:14,that that you know we we didn't get it immediately I appreciate you sending it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:35:20,to us you know um you just uh you just got on the job we'll work through the comms thing it's like not an issue so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:35:26,don't think like it's an issue okay so let me start there what I really do appreciate is that you have a plan yes I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:35:31,mean this is something that the council asked for for quite some time I'm glad to see a plan and when I look at your,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:35:38,plan I take a look at at goal three and I think goal three is really important because you're talking about the overall,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:35:45,organization of the nopd uh operations efficiencies restructuring all of that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:35:52,is so key and important because I think part of the issue that we have faced for so long is that everything had remained,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:35:59,the same everything had remained the same but the situation all around us was changing correct we no longer were an apartment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36:06,with 1500 people yet we were still operating the same so I appreciate you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36:11,um seeing the the big necessity to restructure and to form a a new uh nopd,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36:18,uh one that does bring in civilians I just told chairman Thomas here let me go to that slide because I've been waiting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36:24,for this slide for like a year where is it hang on it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36:31,the one with all the civilian positions here it is I have been waiting for this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36:38,slide and asking for it for more than a year on like what are the what are the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36:43,needed positions what are the new positions like what does that really look like I've been and how many meetings have we had with nopd before as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36:50,well I've asked this question every single one and this is the first time I've gotten this information in this slide so I very much appreciate nopd,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36:57,providing me this um and and I really also appreciate the fact that you do prioritize bringing in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:03,trained professionals to the nopd because data that Jeff Asher has,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:08,provided to us time and time again shows that commissioned officers 30 of their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:15,workload is work that a trained professional could be doing that's right so if you want to talk about the best,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:20,type of redeployment for commissioned officers well then add more trained civilians to do the work that they don't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:26,need to be doing right and so it just makes all the sense in the world and I know uh chief that there's been a few,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:31,little bottlenecks around the hiring of civilians and and so I very much appreciate you know you bringing your,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:37,team Stephanie and bringing your team um to work with civil service and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:42,creating kind of the small working group that that we've discussed at the ca,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:49,people in as quickly as possible because there may be issues with the amount of money we may be paying or you know and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:57,we may need to like tweak a few things but I think all of us sitting together at the table will be able to like work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:03,through these issues but I very much um appreciate you meaning what you said to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:08,me when we first met that this would be a priority civilians right just in your initial presentation I see obviously,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:14,that it is because just getting the slide to us is one that we've never been able to get from nopd that's that's real,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:19,I didn't really have any questions so those are just my comments yeah I just want to say um you know again,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:25,um it's my commitment to be very transparent I mean you know anytime you call me you ask me something I I have no,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:33,problem um giving you the um information that you're requesting or any any council person,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:38,um for that matter um you know um I'm not gonna I'm gonna be honest um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:44,about it whether it's to our good or bad um because I do want to have a great,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:49,relationship with the council and all you know everyone in city government I think it's important um that we do that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:56,and as far as the civilian uh peace is concerned it's extremely important everybody doesn't want to be the police,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:02,but they want to be a part of the criminal justice process you know the law enforcement process and and we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:08,welcome it um I think it's um is the wave um that was open to it uh I had,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:13,been looking at it for some time and I just think it's just best practices it helps keep our officers safe,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:21,um on the street it helps them to get to um calls quicker um it gives the community that quick response um not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:28,those delays and calls and even with them talking about being uh civilianizing um even handling uh handing over traffic,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:36,accidents to a civilian group you know that is really important I just spoke to the gentleman who's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:42,um over um that uh particular uh contract um on at the public hearing um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:49,with judge Morgan and you know I just think it's important that we do that you hear people all the time saying they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:56,waited around for an ax a minor accident for hours and hours I want to stop that that's not fair you know people's time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:03,um is very important um and so I think civilianization is definitely the way to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:08,go it um pays dividends for everyone across the board and I think you're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:14,you're really just like all of us here having to accept reality and the reality is that uh to be a commissioned police,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:21,officer is not as sought after as a of a job as it used to be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:27,um you know but I do hear so often people still wanting to find ways to help you know in crime fighting help the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:34,nopd you know to to be still able to be an investigator but you know maybe not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:40,be a full commissioned officer and you're finding those opportunities and I think it's police departments that are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:46,going to reimagine the way that police departments operate are the ones that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:51,are going to be successful and and in talking to you I see that you are you know seeing that vision and supportive,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:56,of that vision of what other Chiefs around the country are doing one as that you know very well is Chief Harrison,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:03,who's who's been doing that in Baltimore and so um so anyway so I just I just,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:08,appreciate you uh moving in that direction and I'd be remiss and um not uh mentioning um our other partners and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:15,that's um the district attorney Jason Williams and of course um Candace Anderson Bates,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:21,um from juvenile court uh judge Pittman and davaleer from uh CDC we have spoken,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:28,and we all are definitely committed to working together working out the Kinks,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:34,to make sure the whole system um is fixed we all know we may have some,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:39,glitches in each of our shops and we are all committed and I'm committed to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:44,working with them to make sure we're are fixing those things and we're doing it collectively and just checking each,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:50,other so that we can actually work to work together to make this um more,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:55,productive um in a more positive way so um I just want to mention that I didn't want to leave them out because they are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:01,definitely our partners also councilmember Morrell,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:07,thank you absolutely brief question so I attended the hearing as well with judge Morgan and I guess the the one thing I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:13,left with and was kind of unsure about was what is the timeline as you see it with civilianization in general like,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:20,what is what what is a reasonable timeline because as you know the council the whole goal of these quarterly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:26,meetings is not just to have an update on nopd but also we have the quarterly meetings with budget we're trying to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:32,figure out how to allocate resources so uh as we have a tremendous amount of positions budgeted in civilianization,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:39,how do you feel like that process is going and was a timeline to fill those civilian positions well our goal is to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:47,um reach um the number that I gave earlier that 102 um uh by years in and we're working,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:55,diligently every day and I don't want to get it wrong how many have uh the um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:00,civilian spots we have um filled so far in what's open right now,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:06,we I'm going to get that information off our um how many we filled and how many how far we have to go uh with those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:12,positions okay and uh what's the timeline on signing the OSS contract,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:18,because I know I know it expired in December right earlier there's none,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:23,um when it expired I believe we had two cars with OSS in my conversations with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:29,them they're currently in negotiations to go up to seven right which would be a tremendous increase and take some of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:36,pressure off our police officers correct you have a timeline on when that contract will be signed I think that's going to happen pretty soon because I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:43,talked to him um also at uh at the meeting and we have a meeting coming up on the 16th on the 16th um uh with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:52,judge in the monitoring team and we're going to revisit that make sure we renew that contract so we can get it signed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:58,and get it done so we're talking maybe a month or so um and it I think we're gonna work everything out and try to get that done,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:05,if we get that done before the month that'd be great because I'll tell you as a city dealing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:12,with a significant Surplus on the books yeah this is a really important priority,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:18,because if we can get those seven I believe the number he gave me was that we had 25,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:24,000 calls last year they could have handled and with two individuals they handled about five to seven he said that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:32,with seven cars out there they could handle as much as fifteen thousand which would significantly reduce the backlog,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:38,on officers so if we get any help this Council can provide on kind of forcing that issue because the sooner we have it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:45,the better I would love to do that I should definitely um mention in our meeting next week,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:52,um uh but it's in it's routing right now uh it all it takes is um renewing it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:57,again and getting it signed so um but we are definitely gonna discuss it there and try to get that done before,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:03,um a month a month is out yeah we'll reach out to the city attorney's office as well because I know they're involved in negotiating the contract and the Log,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:45:22,have no doubt you will work with us not just on the nopd side but on the police and Justice side trying to figure out,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:27,how we can improve Improvement what additional resources might be necessary as well as whether or not we need to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:34,Outsource some of those some of those processes to make it more efficient um do you have any information I know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:40,that you've had this initiative where we've had to rank contacting former officers to see if they'll come back to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:46,NLP BD do you have any like results on how that's turned out how many have have accepted it and come back I'm telling,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:53,you we're in the process everybody hasn't finished their list because of course we gave it to all the um captains,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:58,to um to call so we have 20 captains so we're waiting for those lists to come back to know the exact numbers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:46:04,um but I know um that had they had a couple that we referred to um uh HR so they can talk to them and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:46:12,tell them how to go back to the through the process it just depends on how long they've been gone,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:46:18,um what they have to do with the process is if they've been gone just a month then of course it's easier to get them,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:46:23,back on board but if they've been gone for a year or two years then they're going to have to go back through the entire process again so it just depends,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:46:29,on who it is but we don't have any um exact um numbers on that but what he's been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:46:35,doing is two things not only um getting some of our people back but we've also been learning why they left,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:46:42,you know which is you know important um for me to know what was is it you know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:46:47,that made you leave and we've heard a number of things but it's still that reoccurring thing that the the consent,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:46:53,decree the consent decrees so I've also challenged those captains and um the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:46:58,executive team with explaining um about the consent decree it's not it you know it's necessary at this time you know we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:06,want of course we're working to get out we're very you know I think we're very close on getting out of it but when it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:11,was first implemented it was very necessary for um nothing else but supervision reasons,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:18,and you might have to explain to them why it's in place it's not to anyone it's not to stop them from,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:25,um uh pursuing a vehicle but there are rules to everything and we want to continue to be the example and motto of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:31,concert uh constitutional police 21st century constitutional policing and in order to do that we have those um things,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:39,in place that the consent decree has put in uh has um helped us to put in place and we are going to sustain those you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:47,know so or um anyone who is really interested in doing a really good job and doing um great constant,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:53,constitutional police then please join the nopd whether it's a civilian or a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:59,commissioned officer um we are committed to um not only serving um uh the entire,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:48:05,uh City and our visitors but we are interested in doing it in a great way in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:48:10,procedural Justice you know treating um our citizens and our visitors,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:48:16,um like they're supposed to be treated like they deserve to be treated so I think those are necessary but those that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:48:21,was one of the things that was happening too some other people just left for personal reasons they wanted to go back home they um they weren't moving here,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:48:28,just um um a bit different career not maybe the um not more personal at all they just,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:48:34,moved on to something else um and some some people we just did not get a response from so we're going to be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:48:40,tallying um what happened which with each of those lists and we're going to put something together and definitely,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:48:46,once we get uh the results from those first calls those first uh 10 that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:48:51,gave to everybody will definitely um forward that information to you and tell you what our results were even the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:48:57,people that we did get to come back through okay and I mean it would be interesting to see what the reasons are because obviously from our surveys,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:49:04,cassette decree was like three yeah in the top two and a lot of people said,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:49:09,their problems dealt with promotion and rank right and obviously the department has shifted some what my last question,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:49:15,which is kind of a deep dive Majors why do we only have one,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:49:21,um well you all you know this just like captains um that test having been that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:49:26,promotional test hadn't been given in what 20 years 18 years 19. well and I guess my point being that when I talk to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:49:34,people who left the department and they give the reason for manipulation of rank one of the big issues and I know because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:49:39,you've been a veteran I mean you've been uh who's also almost as long as I've been alive but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:49:44,um I know I apologize but the challenge is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:49:50,the effort to eliminate Majors was tied to the attempt to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:49:58,circumvent civil service with the restructuring of the department and when you look at promotional opportunities,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:50:05,the fact that we eliminated a significant promotional opportunity and reached and didn't even really in my,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:50:13,opinion properly restructure the department to account for the lack of Majors you have 20 captains and you have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:50:18,one major what would be the appropriate amount of Majors per 20 captains,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:50:25,I think we should have at least five right so if you had four four additional,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:50:31,Majors that would free up four Captain spots and down the line and that's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:50:37,something that I really think as a chief you should revisit because I think Majors could be a tremendous asset in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:50:44,growing the promotional opportunities of the department it would help possibly in some ways take some pressure off your,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:50:50,Deputy Chiefs to streamline how you're gonna handle uh opportunities of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:50:56,marriaging captains because a lot of your Deputy superintendents they're really tasked with like,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:51:02,deployment roles or trying to figure out how to do do new initiatives part of a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:51:07,Major's job in a department in the way it's traditionally structured is to manage the captains correct I think one,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:51:14,thing you could do to kind of show the department is trying to like re-establish promotional opportunities,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:51:19,just recreating and having those tests for those majors and allowing those opportunities I think it would promote,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:51:26,some competition among the captains and everyone from the bottom up because that would be another opportunity that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:51:32,someone could aspire to because right now as things stand when the current major dies off there'll be no majors and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:51:38,there'll be no opportunity and I think a lot of officers I've spoken to that seems to have been the game plan all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:51:44,along to wait for that one really old major to follow up and then just not be a major and I think it's a missed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:51:50,opportunity and something that could show a lot of officers who aspire to go through the traditional promotion,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:51:56,process you're creating another opportunity outside of the kind of the political structure of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:52:03,Deputy superintendent saying you know if I'd put my nose to the grindstone I can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:52:08,take the test and get to that Rank and not just that rank that's a different rank in Pay retirement and the like so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:52:15,it's just something I'd like you to consider and again I I actually um have spoken to um major Burkhart,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:52:22,about it and saying um I agree um some points that he made you know and people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:52:29,laugh at me when I say oh we got to go back to the basics and I say gumshoe policing or whatever but I was here all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:52:35,those years back and when the Rangers were a big part of the organization and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:52:41,their roles in the department um uh like and we had an uptown,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:52:46,um person in the downtown um major on different than just to manage just like what you said the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:52:53,cabins those districts were freed up the deputy Chiefs from doing a lot of things,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:52:59,that duties that they do now so does it have a place I think we need and revisit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:53:04,it um look at what the duties um of a major or our paper normal as far,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:53:10,as civil services concerned and reconsider um the uh the Major's position I think is definitely worth um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:53:18,looking at and I've discussed it with him and um I'm gonna have my uh have Stephanie um go over that stuff with um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:53:25,civil service and see where we are what do they have as description for a major and see if we can even even add a couple,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:53:32,more things to that and see if we can revise um the Major's position okay thank you that's all you're welcome,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:53:42,any other comments councilmember Marina uh Chief just say a a couple of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:53:47,questions first uh all of the pundits and commentators uh when we watch and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:53:53,listen to those reports uh the using the word and you've used the word proactive,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:53:59,in terms of uh how we're doing police working law enforcement right now uh for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:54:04,folk who don't know what that means what do you mean when uh the experts say and when you say that the police department,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:54:11,is proactive now what that means is um for a while we um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:54:16,were just reactive and what that means is we got a call for service we answer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:54:22,the call um for service um but now we are out of the pandemic,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:54:27,we're not Sheltering in place and we need to go back to some proactivity and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:54:33,that means actively going out making a vehicle stop um actively going out making a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:54:39,pedestrian stop doing a business check um uh doing surveillance um and areas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:54:46,where uh we see the data is telling us that they're committing um a bunch of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:54:51,shootings or um there are a lot of uh stolen cars dumped in a certain area,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:54:57,doing surveillance on there here's me rotcc um to watch those different areas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:55:03,proactively going out um seeking those who are wanted for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:55:08,violent crimes um going to their homes and uh businesses to a restaurant people are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:55:14,actually running for violent crimes just doing it without somebody calling us that's what proactive means actually,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:55:20,initiating it um on our own and that's what I mean when I say proactive uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:55:26,historically New Orleans says lag behind the national average uh in homicide,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:55:32,Sovereign 65 percent uh we've been lowering that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:55:38,we've gone down over the last couple years what do we need to do to improve,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:55:43,our stove rate especially given the message that sends to uh violent criminals about their chances of being,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:55:50,caught by prosecutor General um overall our Police Department is a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:55:56,young Police Department right our average um officers has between one and five,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:56:02,years so of course that um season detective or those seasoned officers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:56:07,that um we had they are doing the lean off they're um they're going into retirement age and so but we have to do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:56:15,definitely is seek more training for um all of our investigative units whether,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:56:20,it be homicides sex crimes um uh child abuse whatever those uh uh those um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:56:26,investigative units are it's uh more training and I'm even entertaining this idea as far as homicide is concerned to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:56:34,address uh our sovereign,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:56:48,something in capacity to train up those young people give them that institutional knowledge,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:56:55,um as far as investigating a homicide just maybe four or maybe five you know assigned to um our homicide division or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:57:02,our investigative or division um just to give them that insight and um that institutional response in order to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:57:10,better solve questions maybe write a better report do a better investigation but it ended with that training that um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:57:17,intense enhanced training um that we're going to require um and I think that'll help,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:57:24,um have better solve rates um and possibly bring down on our memory too,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:57:29,yeah we've been getting guns off the street of course you know we uh friendships in relationships with nopd,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:57:35,and folk yes sir we'll work closely with you a better community that that I posted last year uh and it was just,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:58:00,half of them had to tuck their weapons or hold it while they got their food and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:58:06,you mentioned getting the guns off the street uh and someone who saw a lot of weapons,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:58:12,growing up and unfortunately saw news uh there are so many more guns it's like,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:58:19,kindergarten is caring guns in the city right now how do we how do we get the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:58:25,guns off the street because it increases the percentages of violent crimes murders right or assaults how do we get,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:59:28,and so they're doing surveillance on those people who have those um switches is what um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:59:45,those types of Investigations maybe the black markets on the street and stuff,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:59:52,like that so animals Partnerships working um together with them and trying to um browse County's um cases a little,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:00:00,bit better even with the omnivorous attorney um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:00:18,which is different initiatives and to try how to get those guns off the street,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:00:23,when no questions asked many shootings down in this country are considered before or more and it seems like it's a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:00:30,man shooting especially given the type of artillery right and the amount of ammunition so anytime someone shoots a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:00:38,gun now uh there's a chance that it it will be classified as a man's shooting I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:00:44,shared a video with them uh passion uh not so long ago uh with over 13 kids,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:01:15,City neighborhood there isn't a place where they a retail shop in the in that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:01:22,Central City neighborhood but all 13 of those kids had what they call those sticks,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:01:29,and that proliferation especially within inner city America and when in hot spots,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:01:34,in our community how do y'all deal with that because you can't go to a place where they're manufacturing them you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:01:41,can't go to a distributor but they're winding up in our community how do we stop that and you know I I uh thought,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:01:49,about that when um council member Moreno um asked me about supporting the um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:01:55,padlock ordinance and yeah we talked about it being nuisance businesses you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:02:01,know and I know since business would be one of those businesses that are once we severe,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:02:07,air selling weapons out of it or the kids are getting it from that particular business so I think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:02:13,um you know getting to into those type of Investigations during that type of surveillance because you're right they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:02:18,don't make them in Central City you know they're getting them from somewhere but they do not make them in Central City so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:02:23,um I think it's a a number of things that we have to do be responsible with the weapons that we own,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:02:30,um make sure we're partnering with those federal agencies and doing investigations and surveillance on those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:02:37,who uh those arrows where those guns are coming from to see Redlands kids are purchasing on the guns or where they're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:02:43,getting them from and um closing until uh the highest when it comes to uh prosecutions giving them those tough,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:02:55,weapon that can cause unmanned shooting so I think it's really really important and incumbent upon us to really do the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:02,Deep dive and um to surveilling finding out where all these guns come from looking for those Crime Stoppers tips,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:09,that are going to give us that information so we can investigate um those businesses or those areas of that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:15,house that may be um housing on those weapons that are being sold or given to our um are you uh I want to thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:03:34,work along with the new ideas along the way to technology and recruitment now so I actually thought it was a good blend,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:40,of those things historically that we know who work in goal one uh you talk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:45,about meaningful Partnerships uh you're familiar with those old interagency,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:50,agreements with different law enforcement agencies agreements with Federal forces yes when you talk about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:56,meaningful relationships and goal one what does that look like is it uh uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:04:03,those uh uh interagency agreements again or how do you describe them especially,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:05:02,that has not happened here um but uh we want to ensure that it doesn't so when we say partnering um we don't just mean,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:05:10,in writing we don't mean just on paper and that's even with um our state and federal Partners I mean I can call uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:05:17,LSP at any time and say uh uh uh Lieutenant um Colonel uh Chavez Cameron,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:05:54,police and Justice foundation for Recruitment and we would still stressed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:05:59,with not only recruitment but retaining offices are you part of evaluating uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:06:05,those recruitment efforts so you can have input and say you know who's been successful uh who's assisting with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:06:11,recruiting or is that best served through,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:06:17,internally uh and no knock on that particularly agency but you know a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:06:24,million dollars could go a long way right within your organization if we're not gonna get an increase or if we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:06:30,not going to get more recruits because of that investment um and just like you know uh we uh are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:06:39,held accountable and I hold everyone under that works for me and with me accountable for different things we also,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:06:46,hold them accountable for certain things so absolutely we met with um uh some representatives from um the foundation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:06:54,and they went line by line on what um the monies were going to be used for and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:07:00,uh we voiced whether we agreed or how we wanted those situations to happen so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:07:05,it's an ongoing um relationship you know um I spoke with um uh Elizabeth bow,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:07:12,um more than once about and you know I know she's very committed um someone's Melanie Talia too to get this done the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:07:17,way that we want it done so we came to um some some consensus and say hey this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:07:23,is what we need you to do and it happened um probably almost immediately with the um the uh Billboards the um loan signs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:07:31,the debt push for um our recruitment drive we we needed it and I know there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:07:36,was an issue saying that um it was showing that we had maybe 2500 applicants or something,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:07:43,um last year but it only we only produced like 23 or 22 uh actual um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:07:50,recruits and um that alarmed me too I wondered I'm like wow that's a that's a huge number to only just get that um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:07:57,small amount of but after really looking at how the process works I can apply on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:08:04,it maybe through in DND app now you know I don't know how many as many people as as they can can actually apply but to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:08:12,take the test is something different and that's what those numbers mean you see that high number and then you see that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:08:18,really little number of people who actually join well they have to take they can apply but they have to go,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:08:23,through civil service and take the test and keep on moving forward with the process and a lot of times if you're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:08:29,online and you just have a bunch of people filling out um applications they may not even be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:08:35,interested in the job they just may be filling out a bunch of applications so I saw where that was a little disparaging,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:08:41,but I also again sent Lieutenant Nicole Powell over there I I gave her a mission,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:08:47,I gave her a job and she's doing an excellent job I mean we hired only 20 22,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:08:52,or 23 people last year this year so far we had 19 people go into the first recruit class this year so that says,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:09:00,something for her that said something uh for um streamlining on the process and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:09:05,the police foundation um they're involved in it because they have provided those two recruiters to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:09:11,um our uh our recruitment unit or whatever and they're working to get things done so we hope that um we can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:09:18,just continue um to have conversations and talk and um do things um maybe a little more quickly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:09:24,or a little differently to uh make you see uh the uh you got the best bang for your buck well Lieutenant power in your,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:09:49,I realized with the public is now whether it's fair or not is that they're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:09:54,tired really tired of hearing how many police officers we don't have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:10:00,uh all they don't don't care if we have nine or nine thousand right oh they want,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:10:05,to know is that they're going to be safe and you have not given any excuses,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:10:11,if we're in an era where cities and communities are going to have to just,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:10:17,live with what they have how we manage the agency and I think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:10:22,you're basically saying that in three are we being most efficient I think councilman Moreno touched on that are we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:10:29,just in in an era you know do you whether the Press wants us to wave a wine and get another 900,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:10:42,and how the policemen are beat up and how some of the things that are going wrong with the law enforcement maybe we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:10:48,just not in an era where people want to die in the badge or be in law enforcement then are we just in a place,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:10:56,now where we're going to learn I have to learn how to manage and be safe with what we have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:11:02,um I I definitely um agree with that last statement and the reason why is this it's true you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:13:31,shooting and something that was always kind of a concern with me when you look at the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:13:38,connective tissue of the criminal justice system is that that initial charge is basically what a Magistrate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:13:44,Judge uses to set a bond yes and in most cities and parishes around us,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:13:49,most aggravated shooting aggravated batteries by shooting instances are classified as attempted,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:13:55,murder or attempted manslaughter right and I really encourage Chief Ferguson to move away from aggravated battery by,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:02,shooting guards although some would say it is technically,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:08,now even though I would probably argue technically it's probably not appropriate but technically it's the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:13,most appropriate way to track that stat I think it sends the wrong message if someone has a firearm and they shoot at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:20,other person the intent unless like I said previously unless they're Wyatt Earp or Annie Oakley the intent is to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:26,kill them and I think that the department really should look at when someone is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:32,charged with firing a firearm another person and they injure that person,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:38,in my opinion it is always with the intent to kill and I think that the department should revisit whether or not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:44,when charging individuals with these crimes whether they should be charging,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:49,them with aggravated battery by shooting or a lesser charge and possibly with a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:14:55,greater charge that would have a higher Bond requirement because obviously judges are really tied to what the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:02,initial charge is when having that initial Bond now obviously the D.A could come back and up the charge but if we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:10,sending the message to people who are using Firearms injure other people I think it's important to send the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:15,strongest message possible so just something I would like you to consider going forward and I will I think it's um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:21,worth having a conversation with the DA's office and also the investigators,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:27,because maybe based on um the injury um you know whatever the circle,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:33,circumstances because of course each incident is different and you don't really know why until you actually do an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:40,investigation so I think probably um a a way to um better uh classify um those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:48,shootings or those attempted murders I think we need to actually get all the facts discussing with the DA's office,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:54,and they can either go up or down so and then of course the SAS will be um more accurate right and how many as far as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:02,attempt murders go so the example that comes to mind is that we have that shooting in Holly Grove last year where,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:07,we had over 80 bullet casings found shot at a woman and her children in the car and by the grace of God she just was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:15,shot in the leg but when you empty 80 bullets into a car trying to hurt someone trying to hurt somebody and so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:22,what I saw that was released and it was pursued as an aggravated battery by,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:28,shooting I think it's kind of unfortunate to use God's Providence as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:33,an excuse not to charge someone with attempted murder because if you're firing 80 bullets into a car it's not to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:40,injure someone it's to kill that person Now understand that instance it was mistaken identity but that's not really,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:46,an excuse that just changes what kind of murder you get charged with so right just like I said,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:52,there's a lot of pressure on the public on magistrate judges in particular on initial bonds and I want to remind the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:16:59,public magistrate judges are bound by what the initial charge is when setting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:17:04,the bond so I I really would appreciate if nopd would do its best to try and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:17:10,figure out a way that if those charges if it's appropriate to charge attempted murder,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:17:16,I really think when you're talking about Firearms attempted murder should always be on the table with you I think it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:17:21,and it it's important enough that someone's life um so I think it's it's important enough to actually look into,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:17:27,have some um discussions with on the va's office and also um uh our coaching and investigators,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:17:34,about how we're going to um classify those crimes so they can actually be reported correctly okay thank you thank,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:22:13,core things that we wanted to highlight for the committee about our recent work yes that is that's it and so the first,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:22:22,thing was we wanted to highlight How We Do complaint intake and we just wanted to touch on a couple aspects of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:22:29,complaint intake to respond to some to a recent concern that was vocalized by one,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:22:34,media station and we want to make sure that we took time to respond to that concern because we know that might be of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:22:41,something that the public would consider important that our stakeholders and the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:22:47,nopd will consider important and the committee would consider valuable and then we want to talk about two projects,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:22:54,that we just recently completed in January so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:23:00,I just provided that over yeah let's give ahead so we wanted to highlight,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:23:05,a recent report that came out by WDSU that was concerned about the way that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:23:11,handle confidential information specifically they were concerned about the monthly reports that our office,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:23:16,provides to the ethics review board and to the city council pursuant to the ordinance that we provide all available,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:23:23,data on a monthly basis um in that monthly report we provide,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:23:29,summaries of allegations that are brought to our office regarding officer misconduct,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:23:35,and WDSU was concerned that a summary of an allegation could have potentially,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:23:41,tipped off the involved officer of a misconduct investigation that might have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:23:47,required covert or sis operations and by sis operations I mean this special,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:23:53,investigation Squad that is embedded in the public Integrity Bureau that is responsible for doing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:23:59,majority criminal investigations but investigations that might require covert,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:24:06,operations in the form of going to officers homes following,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:24:11,officers in a way where they um cannot where they do not know they're being followed and so there is a need for a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:24:18,high level of confidentiality to ensure that that police officer is not tipped,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:24:23,off to that type of investigation because that could compromise the investigation that is occurring,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:24:30,so um the image that we're sharing is from the WDSU report and we first wanted,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:24:37,to say that that that while we respect this concern,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:24:42,the information that was provided was not correct that allegation that was shared in our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:24:48,oipm monthly report for December was released in January at the time it was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:24:54,released the complaint investigation was already completed and considered public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:25:01,so whenever we receive accounts of Officer misconduct that might require covert operations or some information,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:25:08,that might be confidential that would compromise the investigation if shared,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:25:13,we provide that information immediately and um and discreetly to the public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:25:20,Integrity Bureau for them to assess whether or not they want to conduct a covert operation regarding the matter we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:25:27,will then follow up that um that private form of communication,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:25:33,often with a formal letter that requests the sis involvement but we will not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:25:38,release that to the public until we're assured that any covert operation is closed and complete we would never share,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:25:47,any information that could compromise an nopd investigation in any way,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:25:52,when we share allegations that are raised by the public by fellow nopd,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:25:58,officers or by Anonymous sources we do that to ensure that there's transparency,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:26:03,and immediate transparency to the community and to our stakeholders and our governmental leaders such as City,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:26:10,Council about the type of allegations and the type of concerns that we have about the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:26:16,nopd if you want to go to the next slide whenever we receive this information we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:26:24,do want to make sure that we are responsible stewards of what we receive so we're never going to do anything to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:26:30,compromise an investigation but we do want to make sure that the public is aware of of these allegations of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:26:37,misconduct so we highlight here another nopd officer that was arrested and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:26:44,charged with having a sexual relationship with a minor child and um we highlight this because this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:26:52,arrest was the result of confidential information that we provided to the public Integrity Bureau,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:26:58,um directly immediately and they were able to act on it and it resulted in the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:27:03,arrest of this officer within I believe 48 hours and so that's just one example of how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:27:09,when we receive this type of alarming allegation we move quickly and we move,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:27:16,securely to ensure that information gets to the correct leadership to determine,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:27:22,whether or not covert operations will be used so when we report on allegations we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:27:28,only reporting on allegations that can be released as public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:27:33,and we also do not screen or vet the allegations that we receive so WDSU did,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:27:40,report a correction um on that on that article on that piece,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:27:46,that they did the next day and they stated that they were informed that the investigation was complete regarding,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:27:53,this nopd Captain and the allegation made against him but also that that it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:27:59,was determined to be unfounded that effectively that allegation was baseless,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:28:05,um and then WDSU asked should we have released that information stating that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:28:11,we knew that the investigation had been complete and what the outcome of it was and because of the way that we report,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:28:18,out on a monthly basis we want to ensure that everyone who is filing a complaint,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:29:55,an opportunity to be able to explain to the public what it is that our office does how our offices organized and the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:32:20,whatever might arise and whatever may end up being a priority to our community and to the nopd so it's not meant to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:32:27,lock us into a rigid road map but it's much more meant to kind of give everyone,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:32:33,a guide of where we're going to go and um and what we're doing on a daily basis,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:32:41,the next project that we just completed was and released to the public is an informational tool on police chief,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:32:48,considerations we released this tool as a way to inform and equip our community,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:32:55,and our stakeholders to engage in a very robust manner about how we're going to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:33:01,select our next police chief what type of criteria we should be looking at what our local history is in terms of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:33:08,selecting police Chiefs and what is happening on the national scale to be able to select the most effective police,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:33:15,chief in this tool we highlight the timeline,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:33:21,of nopd chiefs interim Chiefs and how Mayors have selected those Chiefs since 1994.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:33:28,in that timeline we're able to highlight that that there is no consistent method,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:33:34,to pick an nopd Chief and sometimes the same mayor may use two different,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:33:40,approaches within their term to be able to pick a police chief so an example,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:33:45,would be mayor Landrew mayor Landrew elected to do a national search and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:33:53,um hired externally for one Chief but then didn't did not do a national search,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:33:59,and hired internally for the next chief so that's just within one mayor two,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:34:06,different options on how to select a chief we wanted to let the public know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:34:12,about our shared history in this regard so that way which mayoral Andrew oh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:34:28,Orleans and then he left and became the police chief in Nashville and in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:34:34,um I want to say Seattle somewhere in the Pacific Northwest okay yeah so he was technically considered an external,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:34:40,hire even though he was really a a child of us he was a he's been very local yeah,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:34:48,because I never considered Chief Sir fast a lot of people wouldn't right,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:34:54,right A lot of people wouldn't because he was a leader under Pennington but um but he actually yes ended up having this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:35:01,great leadership experience from other areas and able to bring that experience back to New Orleans,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:35:06,we also wanted to highlight what type of leadership positions Chiefs are holding,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:35:11,across the country prior to becoming Chiefs as a way to kind of key all of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:35:17,our stakeholders in to what type of rank we might be looking at as potential candidates for our police chief now and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:35:25,as you can see nearly two-thirds of the Chiefs in 2021 had around 21 to 30 years,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:35:31,of experience and the majority of them were assistant or Deputy Chiefs or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:35:39,police Chiefs already prior to becoming police Chiefs in their new position,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:35:45,we also provided information about how those searches were conducted on a national level so again you'll see that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:35:53,the majority of the searches are moving towards a national model search and as a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:35:59,result you're seeing more departments consider outside hires with 55 of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:36:05,hiring that happened according to this 20 2021 survey conducted by perf the police,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:36:18,outside hires and 46 percent were internal hires,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:36:24,so that means that more and more on the national level police departments are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:36:30,considering candidates who have experience with more than one agency,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:36:36,during their career additionally another Trend that we saw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:36:41,was the use of search committees and by search committees I'm using it as a term of art as it was identified by this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:36:47,survey meaning that it's a search con committee that is predominantly made up of members of the public community,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:36:54,members and individuals that represent special interest groups that touch on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:36:59,policing concerns and they utilize this search committee as a way to gain,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:37:05,Community input into the police search and into the criteria that is used for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:37:10,the search and the screening of potential candidates this search committee can then,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:37:16,transition to another type of committee upon the hiring of a permanent police,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:37:21,chief such as a steering committing an advisory committee or some other type of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:37:26,community input committee um what we were really trying to highlight is that there's multiple ways,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:37:33,to conduct a search and there's a lot of different things that our city can consider when they're conducting their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:37:39,search from how to utilize Community input and search committees to how to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:38:03,candidates decision-making process the way that they reason through problems,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:38:08,and how they will delegate tasks and utilize resources their leadership team and their community in the way that they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:38:15,solve policing concerns we gave specific examples on how these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:38:21,questions could be constructed in a scenario-based way around topics such as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:38:26,how to respond to hurricanes and declared emergencies or be command leadership during those emergencies how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:38:41,things like drones or remote controlled robotics,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:38:47,we ask questions about First Amendment and policing such as how would the candidates respond to seeing a Oath,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:38:55,Keepers bumper sticker on the car of an employee or learning that an employee,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:39:01,doubts the legitimacy of the U.S government and posts about that on social media these types of questions,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:39:09,are meant to again get to the root of how a candidate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:39:14,solves problems what type of perspective they bring to policing and what type of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:39:20,leadership skills they have and they're willing to further develop as the next,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:39:30,involved in this very important task of selecting our next police chief don't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:39:36,just rely on traditional methods to measure officer Effectiveness which,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:39:41,might just look at metrics such as how many arrests were conducted or how many,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:39:47,tickets were issued these types of traditional models that just measure productivity instead of quality of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:39:54,service and satisfaction with that service from the customer and the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:39:59,customer being the community the community is the one that's entitled to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:04,police services and so we don't want to see the dependency on data because data,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:10,can be diluted or manipulated and it may not match jurisdiction or jurisdiction when you're conducting a national search,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:17,we really would like to see those involved in the search focus on on looking at the personality of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:24,candidate to learn what their leadership culture is their perspective on policing and their decision-making process we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:31,also highlighted from different resources that are designed for police Chiefs about the traits that other,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:38,officers identified as being important in their leaders and as you'll see from,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:43,that list it includes things like active listening being accountable to their decisions honest supportive resourceful,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:40:51,and showing an intention to detail,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:41:03,to be conducting more virtual forums for the public to be able to engage on these tools and as always the public can file,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:41:40,to be the way that you're able to establish that so that's in terms of getting buy-in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:41:48,strong and robust and comprehensive transparent search will lead to a better,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:41:54,transition of leadership and will put the next police chief in the best position possible to be able to succeed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:42:55,nopd ordinarily would not be able to complete due to the consent to Crate so for that reason we would just want to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:01,ensure that all task forces and Partnerships are compliant with the consent to create and accountable to the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:08,requirements of the consent to create is it in in your study as a professional is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:15,is it is it possible to have proactive 24th first century policing yes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:22,okay so the models that superintendent wood Fork is using which is she considers proactive,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:28,doesn't risk us complying with the consent decree but not being constitutional the idea is not in direct,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:36,contradiction to the consent decree but how it is implemented could be so that's where we would work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:43,with Chief woodfork and with our federal consent decree monitors to ensure that any tactics that are utilized are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:49,compliant with the consent decree as it exists I mean an example of proactive policing might be forming task forces,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:43:57,there's no reason why the nopd can't form task forces it's just what actions,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:44:02,those task forces can take might be great yeah not not obviously yeah not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:44:10,not scorpion not scorpion nothing that would be um you know engaging in unauthorized,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:44:16,Pursuits I mean we always want to remind the public the nopd can pursue they're just only allowed to pursue in certain,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:44:22,settings the nopd is allowed to use facial recognition software only in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:44:28,certain settings well and only in accordance to law so there's a lot of requirements around nopd's actions in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:44:35,order to be constitutional and to be in compliance with the consent to create and all of of their other requirements,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:44:42,but that doesn't influence their ability to proactively police they can police we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:44:48,have a couple of council members just join us councilman Morrell thank you I mean I think just to follow,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:44:54,up on that point one of the key issues it's actually one of the issues that judge Morgan is very cognizant of and I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:45:02,know you guys are cognizant of is supervision when you see instances in which task force kind of spiral out of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:45:09,control and the Kyrie situation is certainly one of those it's when you create task force that lack appropriate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:45:15,supervision and accountability in every instance that I can think of in which a task force,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:45:21,basically fell into unconstitutional practices are when you don't have individuals who are constantly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:45:28,responsible and reminding those people on a task force of what constitutional policing is and more importantly looking,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:45:35,for signs of people strained from what is allowed versus what is not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:45:40,and I know we both attended the last hearing of with just with judge Morgan,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:45:47,one of the key components that the mod that both the cassette monitors and IPM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:45:53,are looking at with an OPD extensively is making sure that officers are properly supervised,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:46:00,and so to councilman Thomas's point I don't think there's any inherent opposition and making sure,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:46:07,officers are allowed to do their job part of the challenge that every Department faces if they want to do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:46:14,things in a proper and appropriate way is making sure that those people who are tasked with overseeing things like a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:46:19,task force that there is responsibility accountability and direct provision of those people under their watch,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:46:26,would that be correct I I couldn't agree more and that also touches on um I believe it was goal three of Chief,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:46:33,woodfork's plan which was to increase their use of technology and to ensure,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:46:39,that their data and technology is um comprehensive and the reason why I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:46:44,highlight that is because that's what feeds into their early warning system so supervision coupled with their early,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:46:51,warning system is how you're going to catch potentially problematic police,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:46:56,behavior before it spirals out of control and you have untethered officers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:47:02,out there on the street taking actions that are alarming with no checks and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:47:09,there was plenty of warning that that behavior might be present but you had a failure and supervision to be able to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:47:16,identify it and a failure in your built technology systems to be able to flag it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:47:21,right and I mean I think to the point that I think the council appreciates and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:47:27,acknowledges that point which is why we had the data collection ordinance passes why we have a public facing dashboard on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:47:35,police and other law enforcement activity because it collects all that data and puts it out for public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:47:40,dissemination similar to what you guys do so that the public can also be an agent in how we police the police as far,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:47:47,as making sure for example if we see a disproportionate amount of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:47:52,policing targeted at certain racial groups demographic groups socio-demographic groups or different,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:47:59,age groups those are all red flags like basically if if we see a concentration,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:48:04,of police in very specific neighborhoods ignoring other neighborhoods only,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:48:09,arresting a certain group of people of a certain age group a certain racial demographics or socioeconomic,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:48:15,demographic those are all the red flags that we collectively as the public as the council as the IPM we can all catch,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:48:22,and say wait a second if we're only policing this neighborhood and not this other neighborhood and we're stopping,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:48:30,people proactive policy in this neighborhood but there's no proactive policing in any other part of the city,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:48:36,those are the kind of red flags that we catch through technology monitoring and supervision,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:48:44,we'll be auditing all of the actions being taken by the NOP py being able to look for any pattern,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:48:50,that could speak to discriminatory practices in the way that the NOP is policing but I just think it's important,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:48:56,to highlight that the best tool that the nopd has for fighting crime the most effective tool that they have is their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:49:02,community so they should not they should never forget that the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:49:08,community needs to come first they need to view them as their stakeholders or customers but also a great resource for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:49:16,them and how they respond to Crime solve crime and prevent crime,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:54:18,um ojc uh The Orleans Justice Center thank you um so one of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:54:30,issue and to counterbalance it with programs so my catchphrase is Happy resonance equals safe staff in terms of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:54:39,occupation because they really have not had any meaningful programs occurring for quite a while particularly through,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:54:45,covert so we're trying to reinstate that so in terms of causes of interverse,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:54:50,personal violence in the jail there's material uh fights over material,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:54:56,possessions trying to obtain Contraband drugs other people's commissary but also,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:55:01,there's non-material aspects so they'll be perceived slights people having arguments you've got a lot of people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:55:08,placed in a confined space with not much area to move once they're out of their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:55:13,cells so we've got a number of strategies in place um I've nominated each Captain to pick,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:55:21,an area that the monitors have said we could improve to start a proper project management so at the moment they're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:55:27,looking at root cause analyzes and getting a project team together to try and resolve those issues and that will,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:55:34,document it with data have a baseline measure try strategies work out whether,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:55:39,it's improving so one of those things is doing root cause analysis of interpersonal violence at the moment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:55:46,I've been doing resident Community meetings at February we've got over 1200,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:55:56,trying to work out ways to resolve those grievances so one method is I meet every,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:56:01,two weeks with pod Representatives so that we can manage group grievances,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:56:07,we've also are about to train our case managers in mediation so they can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:56:13,mediate between uh residents who have a grievances with staff,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:56:18,and we're also increasing the intensity of training for our custodial staff,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:56:24,around de-escalating when conflicts start to arise and putting direct,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:56:30,supervision into practice so at the end of the day we're looking at evidence-based approaches to managing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:56:37,Behavior so I want to be reviewing our disciplinary procedures then on the right side you'll just see,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:56:44,these are just a snapshot of programs that people are coming in to deliver so we are relying on the Goodwill of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:56:50,outside agencies who are either coming in voluntarily or have some sort of grant money that supports the programs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:56:58,that they deliver but we've also now got eight case managers there was only four,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:57:03,and then three when I arrived so we've employed another four and those case managers will start sourcing evidence,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:57:10,both based programs so we can deliver more programs in the center including a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:58:19,basis we currently have 278 employees in that area we're 209 down which gives us,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:59:50,increase which took our Academy deputies to 18 an hour that also raised our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:59:56,current deputies paid at least 18 an hour with longevity pay some of them are a little more and uh but we still have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:00:04,some challenges we're chronically understaffed and uh we're not meeting the the standards for the ratio of staff,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:00:13,to to resident inmate population even with the 2.40 increase we're still,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:00:19,below the 25 percentile for uh the national percentage and wage estimates,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:00:24,it's with the correctional officers and jailers this information comes from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

5:00:46,not where we're really competitive with other agencies to increase our staff as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:00:52,quickly as we'd like to see,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:00:59,um in addition to the staff that we currently have and with recruiting we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:01:04,some of the challenges are people don't want to work in the past they don't want to be in a high risk physical space,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:01:09,where the where our resident inmates are and uh major Griffin can speak to that he he's here being the assistant ward he,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:01:17,has to deal with this on a daily basis we wanted to include this information because in our budget presentation we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:01:24,had asked for uh other it was a three-prong approach to increasing our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:01:30,uh budget to help with staffing issues one of which being a two dollar increase,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:01:36,for employees who actually work on the pods and in addition to that increasing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:01:42,the longevity pay of 5 from 2.5 percent to five percent on a five-year base,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:01:48,which would also be in line with the cola which is a one percent annual increase but we do it at five percent uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:01:55,it would have added 6.2 million dollars to our proposed budget we'd really like you all to consider,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:02:01,um us revisiting that because we do need the additional resources to for Recruitment and Staffing to to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

5:07:48,um yes sir yeah um you know I've remained steadfast,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:07:55,against phase three there is a valid court order out there um for the building of phase three,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:08:01,um what I had asked I believe it was last month when there was an article written about it we had just asked the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:08:07,judge over the consent decree to take a leadership role in in having some Community discussions about our mental,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:08:13,health needs you heard the juvenile court judges talked about this morning Dr bergton who's a clinical psychologist,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:08:20,is here for just that reason uh the majority of folks in our jail are on our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:08:25,mental health docket um so we know that this is an issue and it drives all of our funding for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:08:31,criminal justice and so unfortunately um we're trying to build another jail,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:08:37,instead of trying to build back the facilities that we need to care for our city,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:08:42,and I would love I was I was encouraged by the city council's resolution and want to thank you for that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:08:48,um and we are um uh steadfastly want to find something different for our community something,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:08:56,better where we take care of mental health in this community we don't build spend those valuable resources on a jail,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:09:03,and instead we we find ways to make that make mental health more robust within,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:09:09,our community um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:09:20,what's the status of those funds to build effective uh the federal funds to build this this facility can it be uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:09:28,have multi-purpose or is it dependent upon the judge the federal judge releasing us from that obligation so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:09:35,that we can do something else with it yeah the funds themselves and my chief legal officer will correct me if I'm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:09:41,wrong here the funds themselves have to be used for a public safety purpose so the city can decide how that works,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:09:48,however with that order in place uh the judge um mandating that phase three be built,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:09:55,and that order is still in effect until it's appealed or or removed in some,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:10:01,manner um we do have uh you're going to need to use those funds to comply with that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:10:07,order so um so that that's the issue there yes Mr Bosworth you want to add in Mr Bosman or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:10:13,council member was the question whether or not we had flexibility in the use of the funds as opposed to the construction,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:10:18,phase three well let's say given because every body seems to be in accord except the judge basically saying we have to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:10:26,build phase three I've heard very few people not wanting to do something else,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:10:32,uh with those funds so let's say we're given that flexibility let's say the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:10:37,federal judge or the monitor to step in at some point uh and do what the what the sheriff said she wants to do is that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:10:44,repurpose those funds is there something better really that's stopping us from doing that so the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:10:49,fund's in question in terms of the FEMA reimbursement were FEMA funds that were allocated to the replacement of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:10:55,templeman buildings that were destroyed during Hurricane Katrina so Basin agreement between the prior sheriff and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:11:02,the city the money from Fimo was given to the control of the city the city used,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:11:07,a portion of that I think for other projects and about 30 I think 4 million was set aside for the replacement of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:11:12,templeman building that is currently allocated for FEMA reimbursement for the phase three project but it doesn't need,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:11:19,to be nothing in the order from federal court mandates that it'd be used for that the federal judges just said in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:11:24,order to become compliant with the consent decree he believes that phase three needs to be constructed and so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:11:30,they're not interrelated they are in fact separate thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

5:13:18,it should have been a direct operational cost for ojc and it's for direct testing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:13:25,direct drug testing and we are required to do that with our uh residents our inmate so we had we have that's what,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

5:15:54,let me ask you right there but it kind of believing some of my little mind I'm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:15:59,I don't want to forget so I usually don't interrupt when I chair meeting but I don't want to forget these points uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:05,when you look at criminal justice systems especially whether this Department of Corrections Bureau of Prisons uh other institutions most of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:13,them in the category of cost per resident of medical residence uh usually,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:20,sometimes double if not more the cost of a regular resident or inmate is some,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:26,systems say have you guys broken down uh the extra cost whether it's mental or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:32,physical uh inmate if y'all set up a category to determine how much it costs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:38,to house that Resident per resident a resident um we don't have that information with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:44,us we should be able to do that since medical and Mental Health Care are paid for separately and I think we're at 18,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:49,19 million per for per year for well path so we should be able to break that down uh yeah well most institutions can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:16:56,tell yeah and not to say that you guys have done this but yeah I think that would be helpful moving forward especially if we're trying to move to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:02,justify something different from mental and medical it would be it would be great to know that housing a uh a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:09,regular it may cost you 55 a day when you're dealing with medical it's 120 150,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:15,a day I thought that might be yeah absolutely council member of Moreno and I would just add I think it would be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:21,uh important to also know if we're looking at kind of a cost analysis the average length of stay uh for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:28,individuals um you know if it's if it's three weeks it's one thing if it's six months and longer it's another based on costing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:35,thanks okay we will get that information,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:42,and to all the points made looking at just looking at the numbers with having,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:47,554 uh residents on our mental case load with a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:17:53,total of a thousand and eighteen so more than 50 percent are mental health patients,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:03,happy birthday about the uh or major Griffin about the uh next slide about recidivas or repeat,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:11,um offender rates so the majority of our offenders are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:18,repeat offenders as you know their career criminals a lot of them get out and they're going to repeat the same offense so that's the majority of our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:25,caseload because uh again what we deal with is in the city jails,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:31,all the time all the time non-stop so it happens so again by this being a city,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:39,jail a lot of them do get time and once they get credit for time serve come back again so that's why we have the issues,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:46,that we have because they've been to Doc facilities and come back to the city jail and try the same things so again uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:52,the average numbers are eight point 84 uh total of violent uh charges uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:18:59,67.87 and then 64. uh 640 total or weapons,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:06,charge 7.17 73 uh total drugs charges 4.4245 and a total with uh property,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:14,charges 3.93 40 of 40 40 of that a total of uh again 1800.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:22,so we've got a population of people repeatedly being rearrested and returning to jail and of that two-thirds,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:30,are um have been arrested for violent crimes and then half of them are receiving some form of psychiatric or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:36,psychological treatment when they're in our jail so it's a very complex group that we're working with well I mean this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:44,this is this data is as important and critical especially given what we're learning now,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:49,about the criminal justice or Injustice system whatever you want to deem it that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:19:55,we're dealing with a population of The Limited population of the same people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:00,who time and time again uh recidivate but there's nothing in place to deal,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:06,with them or to stop them from dissiderating once they you know it's like you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:12,automatically You Know Chief Griffin you automatically know who's leaving the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:18,system and you can Bank on how much time depending on where they're doing time or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:23,with their release that they're coming back which talks about the material weakness in our Criminal Justice System,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:28,but also not that I I deliver the social services and how it works with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:34,criminal justice system to stop that so I mean this is very telling information,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:39,it is we have a um not just mental health but just Medical Health we have a very sick,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:45,population medical medically as well that we deal with as well and so that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:50,has implications for their entire families and when they get out as well so um some of the things that we talked,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:20:56,that Dr bergton talked about as we open back up now with dealing with covid,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:21:01,um looking for we the case managers to help manage them in the facility and when they leave looking for partners to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:21:08,help again when they leave whether it's Goodwill or others try it where,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:21:14,um assistant Sheriff Thomas is over facilities and we want Journeymen people who could come be a learn a trade you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:21:21,know you're an electrician well you can write your own you know your own checker or plumber so just trying to uh in any,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:21:28,way we can it's important you can charge me 150 just to come tell me it's leaking,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:21:35,that's correct that's correct so we we hear that um uh our partners who help with food,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:21:43,services want to train folks to be able to work in that sphere so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:21:48,um we're trying to get to get to the root causes we I looked at the the um data just in glancing when nlpd was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:21:55,up there and all of it uh well not all of it but a good chunk of it was economic crimes right burglary robbery,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:22:01,all that stuff so we're seeing it and we're trying to address it as best we can and working with our community to do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:22:07,that and the reason why we doubled the case manager numbers is they'll be assessing people's needs as they come in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:22:13,through the intake and processing center and then we will track them as they go,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:22:19,through the jail will provide whatever programs we can there but with there's unmet need,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:22:25,then we start hooking into re-entry programs so there's a soft Landing if you like when people leave the jail and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:22:32,it's in a more prepared way but we need technology to help us because there is no case management system which,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:22:39,ordinarily exists in Corrections and we need technology to support us in tracking people electronically you know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:22:46,with their needs and assessments we have the cost on that on the what it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:22:51,costs for the tech that you need to to have a a robust case management system,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:22:56,yeah that would be um assistant Sheriff Morales that would have been in our budget request in terms of the system,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:23:03,but even just electronically that the staff can speak into a machine that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:23:09,writes the notes just basic technology stuff that's currently not existing but I don't know if Dr,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:23:15,troutenberg can recall the costing you do you guys operate with 100 day pre-release Spirit period so what was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:23:22,that like most facilities they have a 100-day pre-release if you you guys have an exit date with someone you know you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:23:29,start third time the clock starts ticking uh to the time that they leave the facility do you guys have that uh we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:23:37,I'm not sure about the software and I'm gonna ask the chief legal officer to jump in we've paid very close attention to that was a big issue for me on the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:23:43,campaign Trail and we saw the story about the Department of Corrections so we paid really close attention to when,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:23:49,they're supposed to get out the Staffing is a huge issue though for us we have to make sure the right people are getting out the door and without deputies it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:23:57,been really tough and we pay really close attention to that that's one you know is you know good councilmember Marino,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:24:04,hadn't been institutionalized but the question is case management is a material weakness in institutions and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:24:10,the better case management you have you can manage that that in that residence,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:24:16,release so that's an important piece right there I just don't know how you guys are structured yeah to deal with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:24:22,case management especially as that person prepares to be released with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:24:28,levels of um mental health needs that uh your population has I mean I mean that right,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:24:35,there is critical to ensure that there is some type of exit strategy to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:24:40,continue the the mental health treatment once they are released and that medications are going to be provided,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:24:47,um and that they they have access to medications that you know hopefully no cost do we still do I I remember we were,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:24:54,doing this or we're but I'm not sure if it's still happening on ensuring that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:24:59,those that come through your doors once they are released that you're signing them up for Medicaid is that happening,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:25:07,I'm not sure we've had um uh We've Got The Navigators who pick up,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:25:13,people who are third-time convicted serious mental health problems in terms of exiting the system but we have had,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:25:19,Medicaid come in I think on a quarterly basis they come in and sign people up for Medicaid yeah I'd like to to work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:25:27,with you all to find a solution to ensure that you know pretty much you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:25:33,know if you you have individuals who are coming in who do not have Medicaid that as they leave that we do sign them up,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:25:39,because that's going to be able to really assist with the Continuum repair particularly for those that are dealing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:25:45,with any type of physical or mental health needs to continue to be able to pay for their medications if not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:25:51,unfortunately they'll they'll likely just be released and not continue this care and then you're likely back in the cycle of being unfortunately rearrested,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:25:59,so you know my office can certainly help in connections and working with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:26:04,Department of Health the State Department of Health to see if we can facilitate some type of path go ensure,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:26:11,that those that come through your doors can get access to being signed up for Medicaid if they're not already signed up and we're going to locate one of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:26:18,case managers at the exit of the jail so that they're there because sometimes we don't know someone might go to court and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:26:23,be found not guilty and then you know out of our system um but I've always said that case,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:26:29,management is the tram tracks or train line that everything runs along so you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:26:35,need that and that's how you get smooth running and people can get a Continuum,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:26:40,of service but we need to establish that case management model which we're starting on but we do want,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:26:46,to say we have reached out to Dr avagno about helping us with uh as you know uh in addition to mental health we've got,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:26:52,trauma and addiction all in the jail and trying to deal with people who are leaving who have substance abuse issues,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:26:57,so we've invited that a City's health department to help provide oversight to our medical and mental health care and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:27:03,we're we'd love to work with you on that right re-entry programs uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:27:09,other than the first 72 um and the re-entry program that used to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:27:15,operate Within uh the Justice Center until it was moved to Plaquemine yeah what re-entry programs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:27:23,do we have um we've got I think four uh doc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:27:29,sentenced um inmates at the re-entry pre-release,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:27:34,park because it used to be with this Sheriff's Office and then it moved to plaquemines and we've had some,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:27:40,discussion I had some informal discussions with Doc but it would be about uh finding resources so it means New,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:27:47,Orleans people are out of plaquaman's um so we need to yeah have conversations,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:27:53,about bringing that back as well or bringing some type of resources back but we you know haven't had those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:27:59,discussions just yet but we'd like to and and I think what's the the book problematic to Mr chair sorry to jump in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:28:06,no no is is you know with the re-entry program which don't get me wrong it's very,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:28:12,valuable that judge Hunter when he was in office he ran re-entry and I believe judge White had the other section of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:28:18,court that dealt with the re-entry program but it's it's post adjudication and so it's like what what is it for for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:28:25,those that you know are are you know free and may just be uh released or may,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:28:31,have to pay um a fine or um for a variety of different reasons,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:28:36,they're released um for already having time served like there's just you know having four four spots right now for for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:28:43,post adjudication and and that's a great program because they they I've sat in on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:28:49,many of those of those meetings with the judge for you would literally have 10 different service providers all right,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:28:55,there uh for the um for the the person going through the program to have access to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:29:02,and that it deals with you know the probation and parole officer they have the the mental health folks they have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:29:08,the substance abuse folks they have the conflict resolution folks I mean they have everybody they have this the labor,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:29:14,groups there they have everybody to help assist this one person navigate through life and it could be like the simplest,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:29:20,things like hey you know I didn't I didn't pay my light bill because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:29:25,um my child had a birthday party and I spent all my money on my child's birthday party because I wanted him to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:29:32,have a nice party and now I can't pay my light bill and so it's about just the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:29:38,important discussions of you know budgeting and and prioritizing and you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:29:45,know relationship issues all of those things are handled in this very intimate space with the judge in all of these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:29:52,different service providers but how in the world do we scale that up and how can we put the pieces together to scale,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:29:58,that up because having it for four people that we now you know have over and and plaquemines,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:30:05,like is not going to at all make a big difference and the first 72 does,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:30:10,tremendous work I mean amazing work but once again how do we how do we just completely scale up and provide all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:30:17,these wrap-around resources to those re-entering our community that was a political decision uh to justify the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:30:24,millions of dollars that they've built uh that jail down in Plaquemine that done the house that many,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:30:32,people when actually the uh re-entry program that I was working with inside the Justice Center was actually a lot,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:30:39,better uh Angola's program by the state Doc's program is a very good program uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:30:46,manned by and invested in about 99 of people will never come home,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:30:51,and so the difference is how do we do this something similar with what you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:30:57,guys are trying to do especially with the progressive effort yeah uh to deal with uh uh a housing uh inmates or as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:31:04,you say residents differently uh something better has to be done and I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:31:09,thought how do we expand what vote does how do we expand with the first 72 does and when you look at recidivism uh uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:31:18,Madam Merino that is really one of our greatest challenges and I think uh what,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:31:23,Chief Griffin could tell you that when you see the same people is because from case management to re-entry there isn't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:31:31,really a consistent program that even if you guys do everything right within the Justice Center you don't have those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:31:37,tools to take them home to stop them from manage them from coming back,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:31:43,you know these criminal justice coordinating groups that we have um uh commissioner Stevens uh had a good,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:31:49,conversation with her uh in January just about as those get back up and running again bringing some of these issues to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:31:56,the Forefront so that we can put them in front of the council for your leadership and uh dollars behind it you know the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:32:02,Strategic intercept map where along this process do we intercept and divert people out of the system into Better,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:32:09,Lives um I look forward to having those conversations transfers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:32:16,okay okay so um looking at our ojc transfers these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:32:22,are uh when we they've gone through court and they've been transferred now to uh doc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:32:29,so giving you the numbers from September uh and through January we've had a total,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:32:35,of 91 residents since September that have been transferred to Doc from ojc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:32:42,and you know with we we pay really close attention to that looking at release dates and um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:32:49,and then of course now the Court's opening back up and people getting back to trials which have been put on jury,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:32:54,trials have been put on hold but hopefully other trials will continue and we can continue to bring the population down but we had gotten down in ojc to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:33:02,906 was it or 916. something like that uh it started to go back up after the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:33:08,trial Jerry Charles got halted but uh we're trying to pay close attention to that we're trying to keep in here that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:33:15,70 for violence and gun crimes that's what we're trying to keep in here and so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:33:21,um we keep a close watch question as your population inmate resident population goes down,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:33:28,what does that do in terms of Staffing what incremental effect does it have on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:33:34,on your labor well again and have in your internal discussions with your,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:33:39,staff have you guys looked at a number that has some relief for some flexibility to your budget where you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:33:46,guys think that population ought to be based on the type of people that are coming through the system,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:33:51,yeah and and Dr Bergman a major can step in here but we've talked to experts who said with the population around a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:33:58,thousand we should have uh I mean sorry with the number of um but 53 Staffing that we have we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:34:05,should have uh 700 to 750 residents that's about where we need to be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:34:11,um but one of the things we're doing as we've been bringing down this population as best we can we uh major Griffin and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:34:17,Dr bergdon have looked at closing pods so we can consolidate deputies into other pods but you know with covid and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:34:24,with violence or with people having beefs and all that you've gotta we've got to be really careful and so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:34:30,classification and where we house them is so huge,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:34:37,um so um the last major Griffin to talk to use of force we did an analysis of our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:34:44,use of force policies and and we have some charts on the next slide regarding that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:34:50,so yes I use the force um basically the the time that is allowed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:34:57,by the consent judgment which is in that uh first uh three days but uh most of the reports are done within that first,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:35:03,uh by the end of the shift within uh three hours of information best determined,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:35:09,when the schedule whatever is our staff analyzing the occurrence uh analyzing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:35:14,the levels of force that's provided uh level one and level two with um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:35:20,more severe is the level ones with the restraints or the constantly resisting while being restrained level twos or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:35:26,less with open hands or just uh South hand escorts pretty much um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:35:32,In the comparison from uh 19 to uh 2022 as you can see it goes up,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:35:39,and down it's uh basically consists of what uh what's going on in uh Street,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:35:44,setting and what is being arrested during the time if we get more violent offenders as uh with murder charges,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:35:51,um where the intake pretty much goes up with the level amount the amount of inmates that we have incarcerated for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:35:57,that time the majority of ours happen on the uh unit uh three due to that being,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:36:03,uh a high level security with uh basically medium high and also I locked,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:36:09,down units that's all people that's on disciplinary so a lot of our uptick is on that unit for the majority,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:36:18,as you can see force is going down and one of the things we we train on it and go to roll calls regularly about that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:36:24,and we have um the escalation training coming in and and uh CIT training coming,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:36:30,in from the federal government soon so we're excited about that we're trying to use the minimum amount of force,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:36:36,reasonably necessary not just to protect the residents but to protect our staff as well we have had a number of people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
5:36:42,get hurt um doing that so we're trying to make it safer overall for everybody in the in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwiJYkLNzZA&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
