43:23:00,ever authored in my life and that was when we revamped how victims of sexual,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:28:00,assault are treated in the state of Louisiana and we did that back in in 2015.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:33:00,um we did that uh with you know working with insurance companies working with hospitals working with everybody from,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:40:00,the sheriff's Association to the state police to the hospital Association to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:46:00,um even working with the general Administration I mean we brought in uh everyone,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:51:00,um to try to get this done and it was a really heavy lift I remember the bill you know being you know super thick and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
43:59:00,it was um a victory when we passed it and we we thought that things were,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:05:00,moving in the the right direction and it is amazing to me that now you know gosh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:11:00,eight years later uh we have people trying to nitpick at it and trying to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:18:00,eliminate some of the protections that we had in that particular piece of legislation so let me speak about what that is because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:24:00,um I'm about to send a letter to the the uh the victims uh reparations board,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:30:00,about this so in our legislation uh first of all we had said that uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:37:00,victims of sexual assault shall not receive bills for uh the the forensic,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:44:00,medical exam the FME or any of the procedures associated with the FME and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:51:00,that was super clear you know and then we we had put in the legislation that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
44:56:00,there would be if and we put a what an FME you know would include in the different procedures but we had put in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:02:00,the legislation that look maybe there's something we didn't think of and there could be a a cap of a thousand dollars,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:09:00,of something we didn't think of because we covered everything down to Tylenol okay down to the medications that a victim could not be charged for okay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:16:00,now eight years later the victims border reparations is saying that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:23:00,the the overall amount of money that a victim of sexual assault can be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:29:00,reimbursed for is it can only be a thousand dollars capped at a thousand dollars now,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:35:00,everyone else can apply for a lot more money but but they're saying that now this legislation seems to be some type,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:42:00,of problem uh or an issue they are absolutely interpreting this incorrectly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:47:00,absolutely we knew what that that cap was only associated with the FME anything else aside from that whether,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
45:53:00,they need additional counseling whether they need Physical Therapy whether they need an additional surgery they can apply for as much funding as needed as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
46:01:00,much as the board will provide to them with no with without this one thousand dollar cap and so it's just been,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:03:31,collective impact model and the collective impact model is grounded in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:36,uh several ideals first of all bringing together uh people in a structured way,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:42,to achieve social change um secondly it is a network of community,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:47,members organizations and institutions who Advance Equity by learning together,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:53,aligning and integrating their actions to achieve population and systems level,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:03:58,change and also it implements five conditions with Equity practices,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:04,Incorporated throughout a common agenda a shared measurement mutually,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:10,reinforcing activities continuous communication uh and backbone,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:15,organizationally yeah our backbone of collaborative of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:21,collaborative uh is based upon this structure which includes co-chairs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:26,steering committee members Advisory board members and just general members,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:04:37,collaborative um have responsibilities such as co-chairs leading and making sure that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:43,the Planning Development and ongoing consensus building is moving progressively the steering committee,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:48,however is very important in working closely with us uh councilman Jerusalem,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:04:54,and I as co-chairs to help establish a common Vision uh and to help with the direction and guidance and to make sure,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:00,that whatever we decide that we want to do actualizes into actual change for our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:06,community government officials and potential funders and then of course there's always a need for an Advisory,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:12,Board to keep you on task and then of course members who um or help with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:05:31,um the leadership is structured as such uh again uh councilman Joe jeruso and I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:37,serve as co-chairs uh but our steering committee members uh represent a number,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:05:42,of different professional areas and a 13 uh in numbers so we have Academia,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:06:01,um Insurance lgbtq Plus and lived experienced individuals,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:08,the listing on the screen now is uh the members of our leadership by name uh who,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:14,represent uh the various um sub-committee sections uh that I just,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:19,went over uh you can see uh in the far left column uh a number of those uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:26,names that are probably recognizable to you because many of them have served in very influential roles in the community,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:32,and have been impactful in their own right so this is an important slide because at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:39,the end of the day the question is well what is the collaborative trying to do um the collaboratives primary area of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:46,focus is to really coordinate care because care is pretty uh diverse and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:51,dispersed and often unknown to caregivers who is doing what and so our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:57,goal is to coordinate care so that there is access to care and in achieving,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:03,access um we will be using a community-based uh Partners,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:08,um we'll be looking at in the importance of insurance on the public private and underinsured sector to make sure that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:15,those none of those are barriers to care the other important component of uh the end goal of coordination of care is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:21,building capacity capacity building also takes into mind the cultural relevance,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:27,of the various groups that are represented as well as those of us who come from various different cultures and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:33,using that to inform how we impact people's lives and then because trauma,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:38,is so pervasive in mental health and mental illness we have to put it front and center as a component of care as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:45,well as training and then finally A needs assessment how do you know what you really are working with if you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:51,haven't assessed the problem and on three levels we're going to be doing A needs assessment of Youth with emphasis,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:58,on trauma of Youth and with emphasis on their General Behavior Health needs and of course the various components of Need,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:05,for adult populations,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:12,thank you Dr head Dunham so at this time I'm going to be going through details,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:17,and specifics about the recast grant that we secured from samhsa it is a four-year Grant we requested a million,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:24,dollars each year for four years we were in fact able to secure the first two years and upon which at the end of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:32,second year we can request the second two years of this grant so for us the name of our recast Grant is resolve,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:39,resilient Equitable systems for overcoming loss and violence everywhere,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:47,so the goal of our resolve Grant,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:53,is to fund programs that would focus on serving Youth and families living in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:59,communities of chronic poverty most impacted by Collective trauma and Community violence,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:06,we are partnering with a number of community-based organizations and collectives throughout the city,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:13,the service providers and these are individuals who are actually providing the service delivery so you have those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:20,Partners who are actually going into the schools and will be providing first aid,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:25,mental health they are also providing trainings to community providers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:30,Community individuals anyone who has a connection with the kiddo they're going to be training them so that they're able,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:37,to create supportive and helpful environments for these kiddos as they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:44,are able to breathe again frankly um then we have our community Advisory Board it's made up of 13 community-based,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:52,organizations throughout the city and they're going to be our voice for the Youth so what do they see on the ground,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:59,what would they like to see more of what are the obstacles and the community Advisory Board will have a fund of 75,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:06,000 to fund other non-profits or other entities who they feel are doing a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:12,fantastic job but they just need to increase capacity so they will have their own pool of dollars to then fund,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:18,each year as well we will also have an evaluator that's going to be testing and reviewing all of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:24,our data and we have yet to identify who that's going to be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:30,we're very excited about the collateral that we've been able to secure within the last six months we have a dedicated,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:37,home page to the mental health collaborative that's on the United Way cla.org website,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:43,we also have a one-pager that can be distributed to anyone it can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:48,be shared electronically as well as a hard copy and then we're starting to we actually created a bi-monthly newsletter,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:55,and this is for members and partners and this is just to keep the communication flowing as you may recall with Dr head,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:03,Dunham's presentation one of the elements of the collective impact model was frequent communication and so this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:10,is our approach to that making sure everyone the energy is going and everyone is on board,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:18,so next steps for us um we are in the process of hiring a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:24,project director for the resolve Grant as well as a coordinator,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:30,and we're also in the process of hiring a consultant that would not only assist with the resolve Grant but also with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:37,collaborative as it continues to develop and evolve and then on the on the side of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:45,mental health collaborative itself it's really looking at the advisory boards for the focus areas and really,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:52,identifying our plan of attack for each of those areas that have been identified,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:58,and fundraising because none of this is going to happen without money so that is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:04,going to be another uh an Advisory Board that's gonna fund and fuel this work that we're going,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:09,to be doing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:16,and that actually concludes our presentation but so we will entertain any questions if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:22,you have any councilmember I'm just going to go and council member Thomas across the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:29,starting council member well of course I want to thank you guys uh uh the three,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:35,ladies at the table have been when you talk about social justice giving back and social science of our community no,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:43,matter where it is have been leaders in that area and I appreciate all the work uh uh Dr Devin you know the last time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:50,you and I spoke on air and first of all I mean shout out to equity Beauty and wbok for starting uh this comments this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:57,public conversation on Mental Health that everybody seems to be part of now but several years ago we started a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:03,segment uh mentally speaking and having a conversation on Mental Health that focused on the black community but also,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:10,overall General mental health and thank you for starting that public conversation the last time uh uh you and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:16,I talked on the station I asked you a question uh about the public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:21,conversation and the fact that mental health was trending but we do we see the policy components and resources,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:29,to match the trend or to match the public Trend and then you said no of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:38,course I'm in a different role now where are we now now that we see political,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:43,bodies starting to adopt and and then councilmember Jerusalem's leadership in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:48,this area where are we now and where do we see it going because when I asked you a year and a half ago uh you say that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:56,the resources and the policy initiatives did not match the public conversation and and thank you for that question,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:03,because it it it's it's at the core of why there is I think so much paralysis,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:09,around mental health and mental health movement so in terms of um where are we now we don't have the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:16,workforce uh that's necessary to literally wrap its arms around the magnitude of the mental health problem,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:22,because we have two two groups now we have the traditionally impaired people who we customarily do the best we can to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:30,take care of with waiting lists and now because of the the the circumstances,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:35,that are impactful to everybody climate control the the uh the the political,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:40,scene we're in now we have more of the worried well people now who are knocking on the doors for professional help and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:47,so we really are struggling to keep our heads above water as a professional,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:52,group to do this work so there is a component of this that has to look at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:58,the role of community in supporting this and one of the things you'll hear me saying I may have heard me say is that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:05,when you look at EMS data only about 30 percent they'll say 10 of those calls,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:11,really require professional intervention most of those calls require someone who can really de-escalate and help people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:19,talk through what is often perceived as a crisis and is but is not at the level of needing a professional intervention,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:25,so training communities to do a Baseline level of intervention work is so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:32,critical because we don't have the professional capacity and it's a it is but it isn't a money issue and I'll say,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:39,that because we've get we've got a lot of money um from the feds for the opioid crisis,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:44,for example and look at where we are with debts and so forth so what are we offering to people that they really want,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:51,and I'm I'm thinking that what we're offering is really not quite what people want even when we have capacity to do it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:59,and then if it is what they want we're not not offering enough of it and the last part of that is that uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:06,frequently you and I we would talk about the community-based professionals the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:12,social scientists and the groups who though they like resources they did this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:17,work as well as the institutions to produce professionals who are qualified uh since,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:23,this effort and now that it's public uh are we being strategic and intentional,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:29,about strengthening some of those agencies those smaller agencies that do the work as well as encouraging,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:35,universities to develop more capacity in that area yes the coordination of Care Effort is about that okay it's about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:41,bringing to the table all of the uh infrastructure that's behind the scenes doing the work struggling to do it in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:49,fledgling capacities often because they just don't have the financial means to do a better job so bringing everything,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:55,we have to bear into the Forefront and also paying attention to our youth and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:02,helping our youth to get seated in this direction because mental health treatment is not glamorous and it is not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:10,a profession that many people even think about um because it's not the pr and the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:15,marketing around it is just not there and so if we can work with our young people be beginning in high school and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:22,then college and then medical school and then resident because all along the way the message of mental Health's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:29,importance is being lost and so you see the youth incentive that's a part of this that's intentional,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:36,um the school board is on this committee that's intentional to begin to build the workforce because you have to grow your,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:42,Workforce as you are moving through the process of change and a lot of us are aging out,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:47,um um councilman Thomas and we need to be able to groom people to take this on as we move forward thank you thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:56,councilmember green I'd like to um thank you all for your work and councilman jerusal for um bringing us together,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:01,again to discuss such an important issue I don't really have a question other than to say that um I look forward to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:08,the day when people are more comfortable talking about mental health I mean I think that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:14,we're still at that point where you feel that they can't talk to anybody and even,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:19,adults feel that they can't talk to anyone about it because it's a stigma and because it's the subject of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:25,Mr brunt of jokes in sabrant of things that aren't productive so um let,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:32,us you know certainly know how how we can help but to whatever extent that we can to everybody who's involved,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:38,some of the incidents that we see the school incidents such as the one in you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:45,know Nashville for example is somebody who seems to have been crying for help over,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:51,social media but didn't attempt to go and get the help from someone who could provide that and um I look forward to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:18:58,the day when if someone feels that they're in the midst of a challenge in the midst of a crisis that they'll reach,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:04,out sometimes in different ways I've had to um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:10,not necessarily an opportunity but I've been involved with some incidents involving the police in my district,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:15,where someone who was challenged at the time chose to stay in a house and not come out and of course threaten The,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:21,Neighbors in one instance someone had a nine-month-old baby with him but afterwards in a couple of instances,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:28,by having someone to talk to at the health department or somewhere else they were able to resolve those issues and um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:35,I think that there's resolution around the corner for persons if they go out,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:40,and seek that assistance and we as a society need to say that if you seek,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:45,that assistance that's not a stigma that that actually is a thing of Valor that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:50,you have done and to whatever extent that you can continue that into everyone who's involved with our mental health,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:19:57,um let's do everything that we can to eliminate completely the stigma of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:03,of securing the help that you need at the time and I could go into other stories that I know of people who have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:09,been involved with trauma who have done things in a different direction than they would have done if they had sought,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:15,out help let's just encourage everyone to seek help and that it's a good thing to seek help yes I absolutely appreciate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:21,your comments um councilman Greene um I'll certainly say that with regard regards to stigma it is so important,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:29,that the community is educated and is a part of the team because when you're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:35,part of a team you see it from a whole different level which is why you'll hear me promote mental health first aid for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:41,example because that's an effort that the community the average person can learn on how to manage a crisis what to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:48,say what to do how to respond the more you are in that the more you understand,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:53,that this is everybody's problem and everybody at some point in time may have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:20:59,a challenge that needs some support into the to the comments comment about police,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:04,will come the national effort is to move away from 9-1-1 to 988 and the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:10,intentionality there is to put on the other side of the line in Behavioral Health trained person who can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:15,de-escalate and knows what to do because they're part of the system that manages these types of issues pretty,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:22,professionally so even in your promotion of who to call we have to move away from advising people to call 9-1-1 and to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:29,call 988 if you have a mental health or mental illness substance use issue that needs to be addressed yes thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:37,councilman Memorial thank you I don't have a tremendous amount to add I'll give a couple of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:43,comments I really want to thank councilmember jeruso for working with you all and helping put this together I think it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:49,crucially important when you look at a lot of the underlying issues that plague our community many of them are tied to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:21:56,mental health even before covid when I look at my kids for example their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:01,experience in dealing with society and the public is so different and skewered from when I was a kid I mean,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:09,just the instances of parent where you see things like cyber bullying where you see kids who through their addiction to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:15,social media for example and their addiction to being elevated or or liked,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:22,or disliked or whatever it's going to be they are inundated with social pressures,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:27,Beyond when school ends and I mean the toll that takes on kids and on their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:33,development because their sense of self-worth is tied to unrealistic,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:39,expectations and the Judgment of people they'll never meet I mean it's just it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:44,completely bizarre and crazy but it's one of those things where I'm sure as professionals you see the new challenges,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:50,you're going to face when these kids are adults and they're trying to figure out how to raise a family how to have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:22:56,healthy relationships in person with people and the like on top of that when you look at the transition of postcovid,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:03,just the socio-economic pressures that are constantly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:09,influencing people whether they're adults or children and their decision making is really staggering I mean,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:17,the more as a society the more as a city we can work together to address Mental,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:22,Health to remove the stigma of mental health treatment because it is still I mean even in this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:29,in this modern society people do not talk frankly about mental health and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:34,mental health needs yeah yeah I can tell you that as as a as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:39,a young adult as adult I've had therapy on occasion because it's necessary sometimes when you're struggling with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:46,something you have to go talk to someone and you'll find very few people despite,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:52,the fact they say that oh mental health is not stigmatized they won't say that in public because they're afraid of how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:23:58,they'll be judged by it and it's unfortunate because our Behavior our words and our words are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:05,important but our actions really dictate who we are and the fact that adults,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:11,and Society still doesn't talk about treating your mental health as something that's normal,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:17,still despite any effort leaves it stigmatized and it's just sad that if we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:24,if we as a society were more open and accepting of Mental Health Services as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:24:30,an option before something occurs we'd never get to that point so I appreciate all the work I'll do in our community I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:26:16,need to dig in a little deeper and we do have funding for that that was included,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:26:22,in the recast Grant so that is something that or the resolve Grant I apologize so that is something that will come to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PTtwGpfmbo&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
