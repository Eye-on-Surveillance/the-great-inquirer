13:34,way 100 here thank you uh councilman uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
13:39,green I'm sometimes struck by,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
13:41,um some of the things that I read and um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
13:43,some of the comments that I hear of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
13:45,people can't separate the right to bear,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
13:48,arms from the right to bear arms,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
13:50,irresponsibly and that's what we have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
13:53,for example in too many situations where,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
13:55,people just leave their guns out,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
13:57,including leaving in a car,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
13:58,um or including leaving in other areas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:01,where they can be accessed by other,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:02,people you do have laws that you have to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:05,respond to even as you're bearing your,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:07,arms for example this city council,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:10,recently passed um in enhanced penalty,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:13,for those who have their weapons stolen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:15,and don't report them that's an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:17,important part of the process you have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:18,the right to bear those arms but you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:20,have a responsibility to follow the laws,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:23,that are associated with responsible gun,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:25,ownership,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:26,I was struck by the story of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:28,six-year-old who shot the teacher,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:30,recently,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:31,but that the guardian or parents said,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:36,but we had our gun stored responsibly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:40,I'm going to use my words carefully,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:42,because it involves legal matters but in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:44,my opinion clearly not if a six-year-old,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:47,got it and there was no lock on it and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:50,that six-year-old was able to bring it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:51,to a school and then chose to shoot a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:53,teacher that's irresponsible God know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:55,ownership separate the right to having a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
14:58,gun or a firearm because it's important,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:00,to recognize you know it's a it's a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:02,technical legal term from the from,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:05,bearing that arm irresponsibly and I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:08,think that that's what that's what this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:09,does and this city council is focused on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:13,responsible use of guns responding to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:16,loans that will help keep us safe we've,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:19,had too many young people in our cities,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:21,history shot,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:22,using weapons that were found in their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:25,homes we have a responsibility that I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:28,think that we're going to address over,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:30,time is some of the things that we've,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:31,done that recognizes that there are too,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:33,many young people who are getting killed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

15:48,had 11 teenagers killed in New Orleans,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:51,since the beginning of the year so just,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:54,in general people separate the right to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
15:57,own a gun from the right from owning it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdn-xkuc6y4&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
