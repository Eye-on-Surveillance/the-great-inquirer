2:11:26,property grab us a a mass property of property but this is one of those pieces of the legislation that bubbled up from,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:11:33,the community I think every week I know as a district council member we get calls about vote on people who take care,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:11:39,of property that's directly adjacent to them would love to have the right to be able to purchase or access that property,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:11:45,because they're already maintaining so this is a legislative solution uh and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:11:50,hoping hopefully that the 25 lives you're dealing with the capacity issue so hopefully at some point as we grow,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:11:57,and as we lessen uh the load of this these blighted Lots uh it'll become more,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:03,manageable and we'll be able to deal with more uh with that I'm moving uh councilmember green I just want to add,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:08,to that because it's important to me and you all know that I focus a lot on certain areas of my District which,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:15,happens an abundance of overgrown properties especially in the desired Florida area the solution to this is for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:22,owners to cut their Lots the solution for this is for owners to recognize that when youth walk by and see lots that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:28,haven't been cut since hurricane Katrina that they are doing a bad thing for the City of New Orleans frankly I don't care,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:35,if the lot is owned by someone who's on another planet at the end of the day we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:40,need to do everything that we can to reduce the level of blight in our city and I'll just be on the record of saying,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:46,do we have to address this issue in whatever ways we can and this is just one of the many ways but I want to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:52,encourage owners to Simply cut and maintain their lots have some regard for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:12:57,the people who are near you and who are on the Block,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:03,thank you Mr Burnside I share many of your concerns I think that one thing we'll find fairly quickly in that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:09,three-month period is whether or not your fears are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:15,will materialize because I think that certainly if in those few amount of lots,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:20,that we have over that three month period if we see them being purchased and grabbed up by a certain amount of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:26,people in a certain timeline that creates a certain narrative then the reality is made this program doesn't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:32,need to be around so I think in a way it'll create proof positive one way or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:38,the other and I think to your point there are thousands of adjudicated properties we have to deal with with blight not just uncut Lots but literally,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:44,white at homes I think the city is trying to find different ways to address,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:50,it I don't know if this is the best way but I certainly think at this time it's worth seeing if it works,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:13:56,good thank you thank you councilmember Monroe we wouldn't have uh gentrification without land grab we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:04,wouldn't have African-American especially historical Afro-American indigenous communities being pushed out,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:09,of their communities without land grant but we also wouldn't have vacant Lots in blight next to Proud folk who live in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:16,communities that are affecting their property rights without neglectful Property Owners so hopefully this trial,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:24,will give us at least a framework to work from so that maybe we could address your concerns and counselor morale,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:30,concerns but we also start to eliminate the black you know people move people out of communities,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:36,neglect moves people out of communities and people who who promulgate and set,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:14:42,the table for that neglect move people out of communities so this may not be all the answers but this trial basis at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:28:00,recognize that you can ask the council for having to for access to a facility and we will negotiate it I'm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:28:07,appreciative when somebody makes something available to the public spends their own money doesn't have to counsel,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:28:12,for it and ask simply that they have not totally restricted access but that they have access to park facilities at no fee,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:28:33,already for it and if you're not going to make money because people charge for a Lakefront use they charge for City,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:34:42,on the amendment ladies and gentlemen uh I was I have the opportunity to be at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:48,the uh at the previous committee meeting where,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:34:53,this rule change was considered um I have a lot of trepidation about this rule change I think that limiting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:35:01,the ability of fellow council members to amend an ordinance,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:35:06,that is immense providing an amendment that is not provided to the author,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:35:12,within 48 Hours of the council meeting is problematic because for several,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:35:18,reasons first we do have ordinances that don't go to committee at all that go introduced on first reading their first,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:35:25,heard at the full council meeting so that's problem number one that you may not have a committee meeting in which to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:35:31,consider amendments to an orange but more importantly when we are considering a very significant legislation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:35:40,and members of the public come to the council meeting to try and persuade the council to potentially change an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:35:47,ordinance those individuals who come here and provide additional information or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:35:53,concern you don't as a council member under this rule have the ability to propose an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:35:59,amendment without the author agreeing to it beforehand and I think that if the public is trying to persuade seven,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36:06,members of the council and a majority to amend a bill you shouldn't restrict the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36:11,authority of as to whether that amendment should go to a single council member this amendment as a compromise,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36:18,limits the availability of this prohibition two ordinances that have had a committee,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36:26,mean have laid over for at least 20 days because in those instances those limited instances the public has had the public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36:33,and council members have had tremendous amounts of time to review the ordinance,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36:39,to talk about what the issues could or could not be and in those instances,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36:45,allow for there to be a more expedited process and more consideration of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36:50,amendments before that 48-hour period so I'm offering this amendment as a compromise uh to put to support the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:36:58,underlying rule Mr jeruso for for a comments well it's gonna let councilmember Thomas go first and first,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:05,of all uh I don't think there's anyone that's been more of a stickler uh for rules or process in terms of how do you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:12,clean it up uh how do you have some water uh how do you maintain some decorum uh I would listen to you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:19,councilmember Jerusalem so even before I got on the council talking about a messy legislative uh process so I understand,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:27,that and then you hear you know how do we begin to follow a process that's not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:32,random uh where you're not just trying to throw legislation at a wall or make fly by night or really nearly amendments,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:40,but but as I've said and I've thought through kind of the history of these disc and these discussions happen with,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:46,legislative bodies uh quite often so the only concern that I would have is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:51,that significant legislation has been done amended and drafted in the middle of discussions uh we've had things that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:37:59,have made marketable differences in how people live whether they impact budgets or where they impact programs uh because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:06,residents are even at times a uh last minute piece of member by A legislature,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:14,So within democracy uh the Democratic process the Democratic legislative process there's a certain level of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:21,Freedom uh that you're supposed to have to proper legislation and to pass legislation so uh I would uh be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:28,concerned that in many cases this would not only happen some of that legislative freedom but it would also,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:36,it would also really test the process and how the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:41,community helps us shape legislation that is before us in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:48,the moment that's happening now and uh I don't know why there can't be some level of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:38:54,compromise here uh because I respect tremendously your ability to want to clean up our process but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:02,the Democratic process is not always clean many times it's messy and then,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:07,when people have get involved sometimes I've seen the best legislations shaped within that moment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:13,well I would say a couple things one is um I'm I'm happy to potentially talk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:20,about something that is workable this amendment does not do that because it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:26,says once an amend an ordinance is considered at a Committee hearing and laid over for 20 days then you go,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:33,through the rule well somebody Skips a committee then it doesn't apply that's number one number two it doesn't apply,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:40,to motions at all and to address the concerns that people want to amend on the Deus we're suspending the rules,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:47,today to add something dealing with homelessness so you can always suspend the rules if you want to deal with it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:39:53,you can also defer while it's on the Deus and come back to deal with it I I understand the concern about that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:00,frequently sometimes happens in the room and that you want to make sure that you get it right but at the same time what,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:07,we've had is sandbagging and people waiting to the last minute to present things and that's not fair either and I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:14,I'm what I'm trying to avoid is two things number one the public not being aware of what an amendment is and I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:22,think that is fair that the public deserves to know what amendments are and then number two it discourages us from,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:29,talking to each other if we're going to wait till the 11th Hour the 59th minute 59th second in order to amend,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:35,legislation on the Fly I I agree that sometimes it can be messy but I'm trying,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:40,to get some of the stickiness out of the process councilmember Moreno,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:46,yeah at first um councilmember jeruso I want to say that I certainly you know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:52,understand what you're trying to accom about it and we've certainly heard from um the public that you know so often,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:40:59,that they wish they did have more notice for um for the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:04,um amendments so I certainly see that point but you know I mean at the same time I kind of I kind of leave that up,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:10,to like every individual council member as to how they want to deal with how they present their legislation you know,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:17,um everybody was individ it was individually elected so if somebody wants to you know uh leave it up to the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:24,last minute to put up their amendments we'll send up to them to kind of deal with the consequences of how the public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:29,May react to that if they want to put them up you know several days in advance so that everyone can see them well then,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:36,great they might likely have a better outcome from um the public and different Advocates,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:41,and and being able to see the amendment but well I understand what you're trying to fix I personally don't necessarily,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:48,think that this this rule um is kind of the right approach because I really don't want to hinder us,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:41:55,um on what potentially could happen on the day that we're handling legislation and so often there have been times where,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:01,it's not just necessarily a little technical change that may need to happen on the day that legislation is being,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:06,considered it's actually like new ideas coming from the public that I'm like oh my gosh I really didn't think about that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:12,I really need to add that and I would worry about the whole issue and I get it that we can suspend the rules no doubt,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:18,to um to have the amendment still added but if there's someone that's already like very much vehemently opposed to my,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:25,legislation that wouldn't be able to happen or to someone's legislation that wouldn't be able to happen the suspension of the rules just because the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:32,public brought up some new ideas so you know because of that I'm a bit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:38,worn on this because I certainly see what you're trying to fix but then at the same time I feel like it's every,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:44,Council member's individual responsibility to deal with their legislation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:50,um the way that they feel is appropriate okay well I I like to close on my,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:42:55,Amendment uh there's no further comments I don't generally speaking colleagues I don't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:00,believe in amending bills if the author is not for the amendment so at this time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:07,I'm just going to withdraw my Amendment and then I'll make final I'll make comments on the bill and vote the bill,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:12,itself so I would draw my medal okay um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:17,go ahead council member Morrell if we're you're withdrawing then I I will close on them on the motion oh well then I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:24,will for my comment on the underlying bill I think what we have today is a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:31,fundamental disagreement on how the Democratic process works in policy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:37,um as someone who's had bills well as a legislator at the state level,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:43,and a council member on the local level I have had we used to call them the legislature,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:49,we'd call them uh we call them we would talk about our bills like they,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:43:57,were planes and occasionally you'd have a hostile takeover what someone would put an amendment that was unfriendly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:02,Amendment members of the legislature would often say well you've taken over my plane and the choice you have in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:08,those instances when you have an unfriendly Amendment you don't like is that you can withdraw your bill you can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:14,defer your bill or you can roll the dice with the vote and I can tell you that in my career I've done all three I probably,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:21,rolled the dice more often than I should and one or lost some of those votes but those are all choices I have in this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:28,Democratic process how you choose to amend bills whether you choose to do it in advance whether,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:35,you choose to do it on the moment that you're up here I think that though,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:40,this rule does not necessarily well actually does not violate any laws or anything out there but I think when you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:48,talk about the spirit of when people come to this Council chamber and they in and people come to that bias,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:44:56,down there the well as we would call it and they ask us to change a bill that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:02,have up here I do not think that if council members have new information,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:08,and that person is asking us to make an amendment that the choice as to whether that bill,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:14,could be amended should be the author's discretion now I know we're talking about what you can do a rule suspension,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:20,well you're back to Messi anyway then at that point if you're fighting over rule suspensions,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:26,fighting authors to get amendments on you haven't made the process less you just made it messy in a different way so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:32,like I said I don't believe in amending people's bills I don't believe in doing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:38,hostile takeovers especially when they explicitly say they don't want a hustle takeover but in that in that instance,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:45,I am not in support of this bill and I would encourage my colleagues to not support it as well,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:50,thank you um I can understand that there are parts of bills that may need to be amended at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:45:57,the last minute but there are a number of ways to deal with that first you can suspend the rules and we're getting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:46:04,ready to do that later today so this notion that that is going to be held hostage is a little bit uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:46:12,not accurate given how often this Council and the last Council suspended rules in order to accommodate things,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:46:19,that either did not get on the agenda or supposed to be number two you can always,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:46:24,choose to defer your legislation council member Harris did it earlier today when there is a land use issue where there is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:46:31,a lack of clarity so what I am trying to remove from the process is a rush that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:46:38,doesn't exist and as being in my view um push unnecessarily instead of giving,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:46:45,people more time to deliberate if something comes up in chamber at the last minute it may mean that it's not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:46:52,fully baked and it needs additional time to cook moreover nothing prevents the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:46:58,author from from sponsoring the amendment it only prevents non-authors,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:04,from being able to do it so if the author wants to accept what's going on it's completely within their realm and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:11,obviously other people can amend their own issues when it comes to land use I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:17,also think it Fosters better not less communication with the public because a frequent complaint that we get is that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:24,amendments are not on the agenda and we don't know what they are and then I come to council chambers and I'm seeing them,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:30,for the first time and I'm watching people in the audience shake their head affirmatively as I say that and it's one,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:36,thing it's one thing and not good practice for us to do it but it's another thing if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:44,you know it's a problem you've been told it's a problem you've been routinely told it's a problem and you say well I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:50,want to exercise my right anyway as a non-sponsoring council member somebody who has not been a piece of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:56,legislation this is not to delay let me be very clear nothing prevents anybody,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:48:02,who is either the lead author or a non-author from amending the day of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:48:07,it prevents somebody who has not been a part of the legislative process from hijacking a bill and then making it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:48:14,their own as a result so with that I'll move for approval and I'll understand if people want to vote against it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:53:31,sorry thank you ladies and gentlemen so what you have before you today is a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:53:37,proposed interim zoning District dealing with commercial short-term rentals the purpose of which is what we've seen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:53:43,across the city over the last couple of years is there has been a proliferation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:53:51,most notably and most recently we saw the Browns Dairy situation happen to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:53:56,councilmember Harrison District but more importantly we've also seen a drive to purchase large residential commercial,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:54:03,buildings apartment buildings and the like and to convert them to short-term rentals uh Studio hotels and as well as,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:54:12,the proliferation of the uncapped timeshare model where they're buying up,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:54:18,large pieces of property zoning them as hotels or something similar and then selling off the individual rooms,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:54:24,councilman Harris has already begun the process with CPC and working with them to try and come up with new rules for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:54:30,commercial short-term rentals but in the interim many of us felt like it is time to put a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:54:36,pause on Commercial short-term rentals until those CPC rules Come Back additionally as you may see we have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:54:45,removed the language dealing specifically with hotels and motels at the response responding to people in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:54:52,that legitimate industry we have a first read dealing with trying to address the hotel motel issues dealing with an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:54:58,ownership model because we do want to make sure hotels are actually hotels and not Sue hotels,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:55:04,we found a different mechanism for dealing with that so that is what this does,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:55:16,so I will move on oh we have public comment on us,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:55:21,oh we do I'm sorry Maxwell piles of public comment up here,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:55:33,hey Max hi um thank you council members Maxwell charger Louisiana fair housing Action Center,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:55:39,um so you've heard some of this from me before I'm going to give you a little new information as well so um in many ways our concerns here are similar to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:55:45,residential short-term rentals because so many of these mixed-use areas are actually part of neighborhoods and house,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:55:50,a lot of people so for us this still impacts displacement eviction removing it from the markets and raising the cost,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:55:56,of housing the difference with commercial short-term rentals is that there's even more money behind them and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:56:02,they're so enormously profitable that you know the analogy we've made is think of them like uh t-shirt shops in the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:56:09,French Quarter they're going to start displacing everything else unless we put some put a push pause here,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:56:14,um and I just want to also note this doesn't affect existing commercial short-term rentals their grandfathered,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:56:19,in um so this doesn't do anything to the 1500 plus that already are out there um the one thing I will note that is new,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:56:26,here is that uh customer mentioned that this uh he's got something else that's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:56:32,going to go after these fake hotels and that's really important too but what's missing in both of these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:56:38,um is that something that I heard about from safety and permits just yesterday is that they have been inundated with Hotel,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:56:45,occupancy applications and BNB additional uses but the hotel,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:56:50,applications are often for single family homes or doubles which unfortunately is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:56:57,not caught by what you've put together at California which is important but it still leaves this loophole I think it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:57:02,just um underlines the point that this is the business model to continue to try and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:57:09,undermine our laws and regulations and exploit every loophole possible and so unfortunately we saw some work to do to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:57:16,close that loophole I would be happy to work with you on it it doesn't require I don't think like a whole CPC process,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:57:22,just like your hotel Amendment we can get it done sooner we don't have to wait till this fall so thank you thank you councilman Harris you want to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:57:28,do a comment or do you want wait till after these I'll wait until after the comment uh Zachary Jones,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:58:48,as possible but you know I just wanted to Echo at this that the people of the city is largely supporting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:58:54,um the actions of of restricting short-term rentals I mean the other day I saw uh I was canvassing uh and I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:59:01,noticed that there were a lot of you know shotgun style houses,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:59:08,um that were used by you know a hostel um to house,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:59:14,um their guests you know and I just thought that was you know kind of uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:59:19,just that was disappointing said kind of echoed up how Point Maxwell made but I just wanted to encourage the the council,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:59:25,to keep moving forward on recipient uh any short-term rentals,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:00:16,putting out people whoever they want uh like uh illegally because it is under,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:00:21,short-term rentals so they can get people out pretty quickly and run scams,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:00:26,for just like an example there was a roof that was destroyed by Ida on the property on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:00:33,um Bourbon Street and this property owner just keeps on a renting um short-term rentals to people like 60,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:00:39,thousand dollars to move in and then they never fixed the roof from Ida for an example just these type of schemes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:00:45,but um otherwise it does take away from um the majority of people that need,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:00:52,permanent places to stay because the markup is so high on the cost of living that it doesn't make room for regular,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:00:58,rent so properties are Equal Housing opportunities for others and that's pretty much all I wanted to say,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:01:04,definitely oppose it thank you Aaron Holmes BC porra,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:01:19,good afternoon council members Aaron Holmes uh vcpora at 816 North Rampart,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:01:25,um we are in support of this ICD but like some of our colleagues before we say we think we can go a little bit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:01:31,further I want to say thank you all for your attention to the whole spectrum of uh short-term rental,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:01:37,um regulation there's been kind of a dizzying array of legislation that's being put out and we're you know we're,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:01:43,wanting to work with y'all and catch up so um the idea that we can further Define what actually hotels are but something,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:01:50,that was pointed out by Maxwell is that there is a flood of applications that are coming in to designate uh structures,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:01:57,as hotels which the average person says that's not a hotel that's a that's a double that's a triple,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:02:03,um you know in certain areas there is a requirement for conditional use process for hotels over a certain amount we can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:02:09,look at defining minimum square footage for hotels um also uh I'm not sure why the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:02:16,accessory and principal bed and breakfast were exempt did from the ICD but I think that those falling into the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:02:23,the same kind of category of lodging we're seeing kind of the Gold Rush towards those types of permits as well,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:02:29,so we support the intent and spirit of the ICD uh let's you know place a pause,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:02:35,on kind of this gobbling up in this last uh you know race towards uh effective,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:02:41,regulations and um just with a little bit more attention to detail on what a hotel a lodging um,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:02:48,establishment a bed and breakfast actually is so thank you very much thank you customer Harris,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:02:54,no I thank you for all your comments I would encourage you to work with CPC and our offices to come up with for example,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:02,I like the idea of minimum keys or minimum square footage um to prevent the encroachment of hotels,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:08,and single-family homes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:15,creating uncertainty for developers but the intent of this particular ICD is to put a pause on Commercial short-term,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:22,rentals until we get those recommendations from CPC to rep to revamp our transient lodging guidelines,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:28,and again I think that once we get those CPC recommendations back we will have a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:34,clearer path and clearer definitions on our commercial short-term rentals I also,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:40,want to acknowledge that our residential short-term rental is back in litigation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:04:05,to really address this issue sooner rather than later is as we see I think there's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:04:15,residential short-term rental market and it's even more important as CPC is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:04:21,considering what to do with commercials that we don't have a gold rush of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:04:51,I'm sorry one online comment this is from Sam Levin who says while the first draft at this mission was incredibly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:04:56,Broad and ever reaching it is um it at least stops the apartment building conversions that were brought,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:05:03,to the council's attention on Twitter but after two weeks of meetings with high-powered Hotel developers the motion,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:05:09,was revised to use strs as the Escape,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:05:27,lead no way to convert an entire building to Str it has never happened and it will never happen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:05:34,however it is relatively simple to convert a building to hotel or timeshare this motion closes the timeshare,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:05:40,loophole but conveniently avoids addressing hotels in any way and therefore will not stop the loss of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:05:45,long-term housing that this Council constantly claims they care about if they did they would craft an ICD that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:05:53,stops the conversion of long-term housing into hotels this motion is only about politics not housing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDMh4kiWRnM&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
