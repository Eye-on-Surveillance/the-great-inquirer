1:15:09,destination during the summer Essence did that and always remember that because I was there the head of Economic,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:12:28,want to make very clear on the record why I disagree that mere enforcement will check the dangers of short-term,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:14:05,of the Str debate there is another facet and that is the importance of community,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:14:10,as part of our duty as city council to protect the health safety and Welfare of the city it is within our power to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:14:56,actually lives and that's called a motel,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:15:01,and in my view it's vital that we do not transform our residentially zoned,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:15:06,property into ghost towns of unoccupied Hotel pop-ups the resident operator requirement,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:18:16,permit and on-site operator it simplifies permit types establishes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:18:22,two types of Str permits one non-commercial which is Type n and two,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:18:35,next piece I think is really important it requires permits to be to be held by,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:18:40,natural persons I think this piece hang on one second,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:18:46,let me finish I think that this piece is critically important,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:18:52,and I get it you know uh we've already been threatened with a lawsuit on this one,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:18:58,but this is one where we really absolutely cannot Retreat and whether you know there's legal action that is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:19:04,taken against the Council on this we will stand firm and we believe we've got very strong secure legal footing to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:19:11,stand on this because at the end of the day I think if there are going to be str's in residential neighborhoods then,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:19:18,they should be operated by people who live people who live in the neighborhoods,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:19:25,and I think another important point to make clear on this is remember when a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:19:30,corporation um is holding a permit remember this corporations can very easily be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:19:37,manipulated and changed ownership can change you know just like that and next,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:19:43,thing you know you could have a a lot of different very problematic and serious,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:19:49,loopholes opened up if we don't keep this restriction of only natural persons,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:19:55,being able to hold these permits it's going to only be one permit per,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:20:02,person there is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:20:21,plan with the sound monitoring devices are going to be required,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:20:30,resolve complaints in one hour I think this is key if there is a complaint from,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:20:35,the neighborhood whether it's all of a sudden you know it's it's a noise issue it's a complaint coming in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:20:41,that complaint must be resolved within an hour it isn't that someone has to you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:20:47,know show up to the property within an hour or to try to fix it no it has to be resolved within an hour and if not uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:20:55,the Str will be cited,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:00,there must be objective and clear um and there is I'm sorry excuse me,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:06,there is objective and clear enforcement here three strikes and you are out you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:12,get that three strikes and you are out,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:18,and when we're talking about a strike that means quality of life violations now if you are out that means that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:27,there's a five-year prohibition for owners operators and properties if adjudicated certain violations shall,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:33,result in a ban from participation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:40,as we've talked about a little bit before the owner or the operator they must live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:47,on site,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:53,that means that if there's an Str in your neighborhood you will know exactly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:21:59,who to go to if there happen to be any issues because that person lives there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:05,and is also uh your neighbor I think another important piece too once,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:10,again so you know exactly who who you're dealing with is operator ID cards uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:17,will be created and those must be available by the owner slash operator,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:24,uh at request so that must be um something available to whether it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:30,someone who is a guest or someone who is a neighbor to be able to be shown that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:35,particular ID card next is a public dashboard I think this is really important so you truly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:42,understand like what's happening around the city throughout different neighborhoods the public dashboard will,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:47,include uh adjudications along with operator contact information that will,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:53,be updated weekly weekly and must be kept current so if somebody has a new,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:22:59,phone number that needs to be updated immediately the platforms must now turn over their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:23:07,data,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:23:13,and let me say this this is something that we have been working toward for such a long time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:23:22,um constantly you know threatened as to why we couldn't do this or why it would never work or why it was impossible,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:23:30,um but we don't believe that and now we've actually seen that other cities,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:23:35,have been able to uh have the platforms turn over the data to them therefore,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:23:41,we're just now following what other cities can already do therefore there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:23:48,should be no legal issues with turning over the data to the City of New Orleans as well,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:23:57,so those are um the majority of the major restrictions that are being put in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:24:48,and let's make sure that the restrictions are right so that that's exactly who we have in uh the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:26:18,a short-term rental the opportunity to legally own a partial short-term rental,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:26:25,it's also been known as a safety valve Amendment that will cost 500 dollars,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:26:32,to apply 500 per application,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:26:37,and it would only allow up to two additional short partial short-term,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:26:43,rentals per square block so there will be a cap and that cap is the one per square block,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:26:50,with an additional two so at the most it would be three again partially owned,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:26:56,short-term rentals that's somebody who is running out of spare room in their back in their in their house,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:27:18,this is less than the four so um less than the four strs per square block,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:27:26,and advised by City Planning Commission again this would be only three per square block,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:27:33,I'll get this as an opportunity to allow the good actors to own a partial sharp turn around,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:27:41,while giving us the community the neighbors the ability,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:27:46,to be at the decisions making table,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:28:32,interchangeably so I want to I think either ask Ashley or Adam or even Bob,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:28:39,um I won't well it's in the czo um all right so in the czo report it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:29:23,block as a city designated Square okay because I I just want to make sure as we get started and people start debating,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:29:30,when you see the word block that we're actually talking square instead,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:29:41,one thing everybody's agreed on is about enforcement and how to improve enforcement and one of the things you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:29:48,touched upon when you presented a governmental Affairs is that everything is going to hearing officers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:29:54,um are we precluded from sending things to municipal court or would that have to require additional changes in the future,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:00,we are not precluded from sending things to Municipal Court in general um that's something that we would,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:06,reserve for a more serious case that would because doing so would require more resources and would require us to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:12,engage the law department for assistance okay well that kind of bleeds into my next question,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:30:45,this case because council member Harris is right um the lawsuit is coming tomorrow and then number two I think we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:51,I think given the fact that we know there are people who egregiously and mercilessly violate the rules and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:30:59,secondly that we only have two hearing officers we have to start bringing these things to municipal court and we need to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:31:04,start having people in a black Road telling people that that they have violated the rules in the law so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

3:46:44,I think it's going to be really difficult to get a license so uh I don't think we need this block face or a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:46:51,lottery system I mean we have a strong rule in place which would eliminate most of the airbnbs these single-family homes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:46:58,where the owner doesn't live we need to have a manager on site which means it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:03,would be a shared rental not an entire rental which on Airbnb and other,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:09,platforms you have two options it's either shared or entire space so this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:14,can easily be enforced and financially I guarantee they will not do this the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:20,price difference they're charging two thousand dollars a night versus a if it's a shared space you're sharing the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:25,kitchen and bathrooms you're looking at 100 bucks easy at least,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:30,so uh if somehow they do get this permit they're gonna try to advertise an entire,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:36,home but the new enforcement can easily catch that you just go online and you can see the options,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:43,um the only way this would really work for an out-of-state owner investor is if it's more than one unit they could have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:49,their manager live on a one side of the house or a guest house or you know so forth,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:47:55,um and also we currently have license that license that are approved for single-family homes with a homestead,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:48:00,exemption well how is that possible if Airbnb is a tire home that means the owner where's the owner living,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:48:07,little things like that can really knock out a lot of places um and so workers handling the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:48:13,applications are a key piece to this as well 25 sounds if you do decide on the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:48:18,lottery system please just think about the local owners who do live on site and who have been following the rules since,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:48:24,day one thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:48:31,um Mr President at some point I may ask you for a point of of how we proceed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:48:37,because it seems like some of the people are actually Pro strs who are speaking and it may be time to start deducting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:48:43,from their time if that happens I don't want people gaming the system well I think uh to be clear and I think this is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:48:50,what at the onset of the meeting I was extremely clear if you are someone,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:48:59,who would like to speak in opposition I think it would be more useful to all of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:49:04,us if you would say I wait until the opposition because what's going to happen is that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:49:09,when we get to the opposition and we deduct the time and you don't have the full hour they're getting people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:49:16,officially we're gonna say that's not fair I didn't get a chance to speak it'll be because they're people that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:49:21,were in opposition camped in the opponent category in order to be fair in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:49:28,order for this to be transparent where people can secretly see who's an opposition who is not that is why I laid,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:49:36,out at the beginning of the meeting that rule was the way we're going to proceed to make sure it was fair,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:49:41,so I want to unless it up here and I will keep time so that Mr druzo continued,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:49:47,going but if you come to that that table in opposition during the proponent time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:49:52,we're going to take the time off which which,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:49:59,here's the challenge and I think everyone is kind of failing at it I think that you're talking about whether,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:50:06,you're an OP I think we're talking about whether you're in opposition to the ordinance or not to the ordinance and I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:50:13,think the confusion is people hear opposition to Airbnb a pro Airbnb so I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:50:21,was not paying attention when Mr jeruso began making the comment will you click on that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:50:27,I I thought I was clear about where why don't you restate so that everybody so it's clear,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:50:33,my understanding is the way that we've written out this particular situation is right now the people coming up should be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:50:40,the ones who are in position to the ordinance and the people on the second half are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:50:46,the people who are in support of the ordinances so just there you go it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
3:50:51,clear now if you're coming up right now if you're someone who is for the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:15:05,what has happened is that the residential short-term rental has been married to the commercial,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:15:11,and anything we do for a mom and pop we seem to be bidding spinning Sanders,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

6:22:40,000 people and then nobody lived here so we had to fight to get back to 75 000,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:22:46,and a hundred thousand and then the city started to grow basically based on the population of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:22:52,people who lived in the ninth ward who were coming back and getting permits to build their homes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

6:28:48,as we came in here under a fifth circuit decision to figure out what in the heck we were going to do because the reality,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:28:55,is there are people in the city who due to the city's high taxes due to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:29:03,a greedy Insurance Industries High rates they have been put in a position where,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:29:09,they thought they could afford where they're living but they can't and I would say though we discounted that is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

6:29:23,common than you don't in that people thought they could afford to live here and they couldn't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

6:29:36,walk into these situations you kind of have a duty to mitigate where you're trying to figure out what,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:29:42,can I do with a set of awful circumstances to try and promote the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:29:47,least harm and I think what you're seeing as the council repeatedly butts heads over how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:29:54,we're going to try or how to how to move forward we're trying to figure out what can we do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:30:00,when I made that comment at the beginning of this entire debate about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:30:05,pain is that there's no solution that we're going to come up with today that's not going to hurt people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:30:10,because it's unavoidable there are going to be people even with councilman King's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:30:16,Amendment shouldn't get on there are going to be people who are a good neighbor who are someone who,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:30:25,can't afford their home who just aren't going to be able to get in there's no way for us to come up with a scenario,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:30:31,where that's not a possibility and likewise they're going to be neighborhoods where,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

6:30:43,strs who are traumatized by that that aren't going to have that immediately rectified,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:30:49,what I will tell you as we go forward today is that I can,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:30:54,speak for a lot of my colleagues in that the villain of this story is not in this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:31:02,room it's the platforms and I say that because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:31:09,as we said months ago when I was running for office just as a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

6:31:34,actors to make profit they can't make profit without the platforms,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:31:41,if the platforms were truly interested in protecting the good actors and not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:31:47,rewarding the Bad actors you wouldn't have six thousand,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:31:52,str's UW 1200. that's a fact,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

6:32:03,so that being said part of what you see in councilman Moreno's Amendment forcing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:32:09,interaction with the platforms is that they have a responsibility and a duty to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:32:16,help us police short-term rentals because no matter how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

6:32:35,and if those platforms will do their job then we won't be here having to do their,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:32:42,job for them now that being said,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:32:47,I think I speak for a lot of my colleagues when having been through this entire exercise,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:32:52,there is this idea and we already hear it they're people lawyers we're going to sue this we're going to sue that we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

6:33:31,greatest thing in the world and it was super easy and Dionysus said you can be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:33:36,king for a day and put him on the throne and hung a sword above his head held by,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:33:42,a horsehair because he said the ability to lead and govern and have power is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:33:48,literally at the whim of the people and God God's probably was Greece,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:33:54,and let me tell you this we as a council are fed up with greed and platforms,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:34:02,abusing the system what you see today from us is our last,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:34:08,best effort in my opinion if it comes back yet again with these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
6:34:15,greedy platforms that they refuse to be regulated we shall be the Sword of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

6:34:32,because we as a council as a community cannot continue to operate in good faith,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-oOFqv70&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
