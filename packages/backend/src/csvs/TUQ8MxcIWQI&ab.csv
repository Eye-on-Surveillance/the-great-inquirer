1:06:50,more it is our belief that we can expand the good work that we are doing at Bastion,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:06:57,beyond our boundaries and eventually bring our model of care to every veteran in need across the city of New Orleans,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:04,you know it was my intention in putting this presentation together to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:11,start with a story about how we got here but as council member Moreno has articulated I believe that most if not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:17,all of the members of this Council uh know who we are and and fundamentally what we do and why,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:24,so rather than than rehash that story for you I want to bring you up to speed on on where we've gotten,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:31,uh I know that this Council was intimately involved in all of the work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:36,required to to procure the zoning and the conditional use permit for our veteran Wellness Center,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:43,um that work really came to a head in in 2020. uh in the three years since then,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:48,we have worked tirelessly not only to navigate the unforeseen challenges of covid but to bring our model of care to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:07:56,its utmost potential on miribo Avenue and we've done that I'm going to explain how,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:02,like I said we think that we are now ready to expand that reach far far wider,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:07,because the need is there there's a lot of information up on this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:13,slide but I want to draw one number to your attention in particular nearly 15 000 veterans that call the City of New,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:20,Orleans home that is our Target population the City of New Orleans has worked,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:25,admirably to mitigate and at times nearly eliminate the issue of Veteran homelessness in this city,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:32,but as I think we are all aware I mean null.com ran three or four articles on various facets of this issue just this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:39,week uh housing is only half of the battle to to put every veteran in this city in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:46,stable housing is important it's critical uh but we are not done there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:51,think about the story that ran on nola.com on Monday,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:08:57,about the issue of homeless encampments in this city and the issue of putting resources in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:09:29,veterans deal with look at some of the other numbers on this slide traumatic brain injury the signature,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:35,wound of the war on terror of which I'm a veteran nearly 900 000 veterans Nationwide contend with this injury,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:42,veterans are already three times as likely as their civilian counterparts to commit suicide,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:48,in instances of traumatic brain injury veterans are twice as likely as their civilian counterparts to take their own,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:54,lives and that risk doubles again in instances of multiple or severe TBI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:09:59,the issues that these veterans contend with are not mitigated merely by the provision of housing anxiety depression,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:07,social isolation difficulty holding a job difficulty starting or maintaining,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:10:26,long term that's where Bastion comes in you know at Bastion our motto is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:31,community as the intervention and the way that I used to explain that was to say at Bastion neighbors help Neighbors,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:38,at Bastion you've got your neighbor to come over in the morning to remind you to take your prescription medication or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:10:45,she might come over in the afternoon to give you a ride to to the doctor's office because you can't drive and I was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:11:09,intervention a trip to the doctor's office is the intervention the neighbor is merely facilitating those things and that's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:15,important but that's not what we're talking about when we say community as the intervention,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:20,when we use that motto what we mean is at Bastion those relationships themselves are the treatment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:11:28,the cultivation of deep meaningful relationships of understanding and Care is a form of treatment in its own right,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:12:31,where we can identify that that a veteran is having issues with his sobriety that he may be getting behind,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:12:37,on his rent that he's got health issues that are starting to Bubble Up and disrupt his finances it will be his,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:13:50,dealing with issues like PTSD and brain injuries the prospect of Vocational Rehabilitation is a daunting one you are,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:13:58,necessarily taking that veteran to the limits of his capabilities and saying we think you are ready to go back to work,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:05,well if the first step that that veteran takes in that journey is now outside of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:11,our community in a setting with maybe an unfamiliar employer unfamiliar challenges there is a pretty good chance,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:14:50,that will have on the confidence that that veteran has built for himself over his months of work at Bastion so through,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:14:56,our resident Employment Program we take those first steps within the community we can tell the veteran we think that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

1:15:21,all he has to do is walk across the lawn to a social worker and say hey I have an hour left in my shift would it be all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:28,right if I take a few minutes to myself I'm feeling a little bit overwhelmed now that process continues to be therapeutic,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:34,and forward moving and this approach works,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:40,you see a lot of Statistics up on this slide and and I won't read them to you what I'd like to do instead is zoom out,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:47,a bit and give you some perspective bastion's been collecting survey data across our community for five years now,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:15:55,this survey measures metrics like social connectedness engagement and meaningful,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:00,activities sense of personal safety and in five years of collecting this data,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:05,highest scores we ever recorded we're at the peak of the covet pandemic in 2021,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:12,how can that be that at a time when our city was being devastated by the effects of this virus,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:20,in a population that is already so vulnerable to the obstacles and difficulties that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:25,life can present how is it that under those circumstances that our community was thriving,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:32,it is because at bashed and we understand what all new orleanians understand that when times are hardest,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:39,when the situation looks darkest that is when we reach out to our neighbors and grasp hold of one another,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:46,it was when times were hardest at Bastion that our residents most acutely,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:52,felt the support they had built around them I always tell people it is no accident,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:16:58,that Bastion was started in New Orleans we are still the only program of Our,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:03,Kind anywhere in the country there is nobody else in the United States who is doing or frankly who can do what we do,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:11,which is to provide a community-based model of care for our veterans a model,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:16,in which they can build lives in the long term it's not a program that they attend for three months and then move on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:22,with their lives this is a program where they can build that life here in New Orleans it is no accident that this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:29,program started here this place understands better than anywhere else in this country what it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:35,means to lose everything and what it means to lift one another back up and proceed together,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:40,that is what we do at Bastion and I can tell you these anecdotes I can show you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
1:17:46,these numbers on this slide but I think to truly understand the impact of this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:32:59,just about some of the history about how the place had been used uh not whether it was used right or wrong uh but it was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:33:06,used in the ceremonious celebratory process for dignitarians as a state uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:33:19,the city would not give the data but but also I think hopefully uh do what he,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:33:25,wants to do is that if elected officials and others would use it uh they would have to pay me market value and it could,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:33:31,not be a place that an elected officials would use to stay in so I think uh given,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:33:37,on our staff and Adam and who worked on this amendment uh I've been told that this would allow us to do both uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:34:05,meet with council member Thomas on this amendment well on the idea of the amendment a pawn review I cannot support,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:12,this amendment I think that it does not address the underlying issue of a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:18,city-owned property which could potentially generate Revenue not generating Revenue further I think that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:25,it is problematic when there is open interpretation of things,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:30,like periodic use like who defines what periodic use is could periodic use be there four days out of the week not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:37,three it's just I think the goal and when I brought this ordinance was to resolve this issue,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:43,definitively and to Simply State for the record that we as a city do not have a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:52,residence for Mayors and further and the oig is here to answer questions if we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:34:57,have any but there is an underlying legal issue regarding gratuitous donation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:04,in the 1950 in the 1950s when the governor's mansion was created they created a statute to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:12,exempt the governor for paying for the Governor's Mansion when the 1974 Constitution was done it is so strict,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:20,and specific on gratuitous donations they had to have a constitutional provision to codify the governor's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:27,continued use of the mansion that is how seriously the state constitution is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:33,against public officials receiving anything of value including their residence,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:40,and Views it as a gratuitous donation I think that there are significant underlying legal issues with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:45,practice this is not something that I'm directing towards any specific mayor,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:51,it's simply that recent developments have brought this issue to the fore and I think that we need to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:35:58,definitively resolve this going forward because in a city where it is so hard to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:36:06,pay rent and find somewhere to live I think that any kind of official or unofficial housing or an elected,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:36:12,official to sends the wrong message that's all I have to say customer Mourinho thank you councilmember Thomas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:36:20,um in reading your Amendment um I I see you know what your intent is about still,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:36:25,keeping it as some type of you know Civic purpose I think where we run into issues here is actually on the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:36:32,residential or the housing piece and I I think back my days in the Louisiana legislature and uh and there's a series,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:36:41,of of Apartments they're called The Pentagon apartments and and those apartments are for legislators in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:36:47,particular the speaker of the house and the Senate President they each um get an apartment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:36:53,but the key here is they all have to pay rent they all have to pay rent in these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:36:59,particular Apartments so I think it's one thing to have a piece of property being utilized for a Civic purpose but I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:06,think the the problem that we get into is the the housing piece of staying,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:12,overnight um and so because of that I I I think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:17,that your amendment is still problematic uh councilmember Thomas but that's just that's just my two cents,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:26,[Music] you're not I'm not an attorney and I'm never the smartest person in the room,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:33,because I like I've always tried to learn from everyone in the room so I asked Howard Council another staff uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:40,the amendment was drafted in a way to protect what I think are uh to uh Council,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:47,leaders uh uh uh Mourinho and Morrell are trying to do it in terms of clear,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:37:53,that language there but also give the city the ability to continue to use this as an asset so I think in even,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:02,in one of our conversations uh someone who's in opposition had to admit that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:07,the Forty thousand dollars wasn't an issue because if it was the right way for dignitaries,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:15,way that it would yield more benefit than that uh I haven't been told by any attorneys,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:23,I know we have great attorneys up here in councilman Morales one of the best uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:29,but I have not been told by our attorneys that it doesn't address the issues that you guys bring forward and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:36,so if they haven't said it does then I would still move forward for adoption,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:41,and everybody wrote their Consciousness yes thank you so talking to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:49,colleagues on on this end of the desk it seems like most of us are all of us on the same page,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:38:55,um if we can maybe it's my suggestion take a couple words out of this I think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:01,the residential part is what a lot of people have are the amendment is not bad but if we could just tighten it up a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:07,little bit and take out the residential part I think everyone could be on the same page or at least again some of my,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:13,colleagues on this end of the day because I haven't spoke to that side um that's just my suggestion I know that's possible but that's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:20,the opportunity to find consensus around an issue uh that the public is concerned,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:27,about and I know councilman Morrell has consistently said he wants to put this issue to bear it then if the language,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:34,puts it to bed but finds a way that we can do both then let there be that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:42,language uh I'm just trying to find a way uh that we can continue to do both,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:50,and the issue around affordable housing is I mean it would be great if that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:39:56,would be a Section 8 unit it would be will be great if we could rotate it for a homeless family uh to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:40:04,live there but there's historical news there you know I could name the dates and name the dignitarians and name the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:40:10,folks so I'm not trying to complicate it I was just trying to find a way that and I said uh could continue to be an asset,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:40:17,but also prohibit the elected officials or Mayors from taking advantage of it that's that's guys you know I ain't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:40:24,trying to protect any man or go after any mail or I was trying to find a way,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:40:30,especially into talking and focus on its history was to find a way we could do both that's it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:40:35,uh council president can can we ask our uh Council to brief us on gratuitous,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:40:42,donation and the meaning of gratitude destination under what I would say is we have the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:40:48,office of Inspector General here today well in their analysis to discuss gratuitous,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:40:54,donations so so can they publicly talk about computers donations further I think they also have some information,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:00,regarding the foreign dignitary issue as well okay so both of those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:18,good afternoon thank you for uh inviting me to um talk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:24,about this report that we recently released um before I do that I I just wanted to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:29,state that um our main objective is to mitigate fraud waste and abuse and to ensure good governance at all levels it's required,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:37,by us in the statute city code and and the ordinance so it's it's annotated,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:43,three different places before I talk about um the report I wanted to touch base,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:49,I've heard a lot of talk about dignitaries and dignitaries staying at this location,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:41:56,um in my previous role working for the I never said the return I stayed there so there were people who were hosted,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:42:03,people there I don't know of any dignitaries that stayed there so I've heard some talk about put pot,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:42:10,potentially having this as a residence or a place for dignitaries in my previous role,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:42:16,um in working for the um FBI one of those roles was the acting section chief,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:42:23,of the security department which was responsible for the executive protection of the Attorney General of the United,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:42:28,States of America as well as the Director of the FBI so I feel like I can speak with some certainty about some of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:42:35,the issues regarding the use of this location by dignitaries,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:42:41,that location is one way in and one way out it's a choke point and it's an,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:42:47,egress it's not good as well if there is a fire hazard,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:42:52,should an emergency occur you don't want to put a high value Target at that location,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:42:59,there's no possibility for this location of establishing a safe room,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:43:04,there's no ability to drop off dignitaries with vehicles at the front entrance due to the incredibly High foot,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:43:11,traffic of the pedestrians in the area there's no possibility to do counter,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:43:17,surveillance in the area there's there's so much foot traffic in that area that there would be no way to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:43:24,differentiate um friend from foe because there is so much traffic in that area one of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:43:30,things that they do when they establish a pattern of dignitaries is who's there who's coming in who has access and quite,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:43:36,frankly from the from the security footage that we viewed there are literally hundreds of people that pass,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:43:42,by that location within minutes what traffic I've talked about is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:43:47,incredibly High keeping an eye on a dignitary in that location with foot traffic it's next to Impossible,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:43:54,due to the location medical and or fire emergency would be hindered because,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:43:59,again getting in and out is a can be problematic the balcony area creates an issue if a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:44:06,dignitary is out there depending on the threat level um there's there's no standoff range and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:44:12,when I say that um I quite frankly mean that if a dignitary is on that location or a high,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:44:19,value Target they are within pistol range in addition to being within pistol,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:44:25,range they have access to Long barrels because of the large area out front that is completely vacant it's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:44:33,and lastly there's no Personnel or staging area for vehicles and it's going,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:44:39,to be hard to establish an Outer Perimeter which is what you want for any high value Target so I I really don't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:44:45,think that this is a good place to put any high level dignitary okay but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:44:51,my question was on gratuitous donation so can you talk about that yeah okay I didn't I didn't think this would be FBI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:44:58,files and shooter and yeah,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:03,because I've never mentioned anything about I just wanted I said it was it was used as an event historically but,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:11,notables and dignitarians and celebrities would go I don't know of any dignitarians who've ever stayed there,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:16,I've been took a quarter to investment dignitarians at places that are much,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:22,more open than that so with with regard to the the Louisiana Constitution,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:29,um there's something called the Cabela test and the use of this apartment is uh should be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:35,um it should pass a three-prong test so the use of the apartment should be for a public purpose clearly a public purpose,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:43,um the second one is the use of the apartment must not appear to be gratuitous so having people go there in the middle,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:49,of the night having family members stay over that's gratuitous,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:45:54,and lastly and this is going to be the most difficult part in my opinion um for any board to overcome,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:46:02,the public has to have a reasonable expectation of receiving a benefit in the amount of the money transferred in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:46:08,this case the the city has said it is committed to obtaining fair market value for all publicly owned property,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:46:16,placing this apartment on the rent rolls would honor the commitment the city has said repeatedly to obtain fair market,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:46:22,value for all publicly owned property in this case the public has a reasonable expectation of receiving a benefit equal,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:46:30,to the amount transferred in this case it's twenty nine hundred dollars every month as well as five to six thousand,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:46:36,dollars a year for utilities and I also want to touch base with the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:46:43,the use of this apartment um appears to be and it appears to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:46:48,duplicate a public purpose for instance City Hall is a half a mile away,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:46:53,the home Rule Charter states that the mayor's office Shelby and City Hall Galleria Hall is the official reception,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:46:59,place for the mayor and provides a superior venue for any event no I listen I appreciate that but my my,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:47:06,question was purely the legal issue of gratuitous donation I think that any,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:47:11,time that we're disposing or using a city property I think the law is clear that you have to get fair market value,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:47:17,for that um use so I think that I think on a legal basis there's under the law of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:47:23,gratuitous donation the issue is pretty clear that if you're going to give a city property or use a city property to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:47:30,any entity that you need to get fair market value or some public benefit for,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:47:36,use of that property and that's that's all I wanted clarification yeah and and but more specifically the public value,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:47:42,has to be the benefit of what that apartment could rent for in this case 2 900 a month every month okay thank you I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:47:48,just wanted to make sure that that way I think I'll turn you know some potential uh we're doing clarification that could,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:47:54,satisfy some of the concerns here Adam,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:48:02,we're working on it now but generally speaking uh on the lines two and three,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:48:08,of the written amendment that the council members have if we strike the words periodic residential,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:48:14,and on the third to last line we strike the word residential that eliminates the residential use and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:48:22,if one was so inclined you could outright prohibit overnight stays in a standalone sentence yeah I think that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:48:29,Adam as we were talking um that's a sentence that I would want at the end that overnight stays are prohibited and I would also mention that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:48:36,the way that this whole piece of legislation is already written and Adam are actually please correct me if I'm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:48:41,wrong that any future mayor could also say that they do not want to utilize this apartment in any way and turn it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:48:48,back over to the board to be able to rent and collect dollars going back in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:48:54,in into the into the converse if necessary is that correct so it's at the city's the May means that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:49:01,it's at the city's discretion so it would be at the mayor although I think it would be subject to Direction additional Direction by the council if,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:49:08,the council a future Council chose to legislate in that area would you need explicit language in there then to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:49:14,clarify that any future mayor could decide on their own to relinquish the apartment and give it back into,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:49:22,um into the board's hands to rent out foreign,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:49:29,it's implicit if you wanted to make it explicit I think after the word City in the very second word you could say at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:49:35,the mayor's discretion at which point then I think it's clear okay thank you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:49:43,is that the amendment to the event I think it would be useful to everyone who's following this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:49:50,if you could actually read what we're voting on okay it seems like there's amendments to the amendment to the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:49:56,amendment and I think there needs to be a clear articulation of what the current Amendment actually will read as agree,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:04,Adam is writing it right now he's just adding that final sentence and I guess Mr President,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:10,um and I I almost hate bringing this up in the middle of the meeting I appreciate what we're trying to do today,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:15,which is be fair and provide a semblance of balance to everything and I think I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:20,would like to think about maybe implementing a rule about when amendments get due so that way we have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:26,ample time to negotiate them I realize sometimes things will happen on the Deus and I think we're making them better,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:32,right now well but I know I I've had legislation before pass Council this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:38,Council where an amendment comes late and I think what we're all trying to do is streamline this for the public yeah,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:43,and you and I have talked about that before because a lot of times we're bombarded with amendments at the last,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:48,minute uh um you know if if that rule could be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:50:54,fair and apply to everyone then uh I think that's actually the best way to do it uh and I apologize for it but my,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:51:02,amendment was passed around yesterday and the other amendments are just an attempt to try to corrupt the language,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:51:07,that councilman Moreno our council member has said I don't have a problem deferring it uh and that's probably the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:51:14,best thing to do so that we could get it right so that the public could read it uh Inspector General could read it and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:51:20,everyone how could be clear I mean that's what so I I do apologize vending lateness that I impacted with all due,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:51:27,respect to all parties present this bill was pre-filed two weeks ago so if amendments are coming in 24 hours before,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:51:34,the meeting I do not want to start the practice of if a bill is properly filed two weeks,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:51:40,before a council meeting that we start deferring bills because we're hashing out last minute amendments so my,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:51:47,preference as the author of the underlying bill would be to vote on it today and to not have this languishing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:51:53,on the agenda for another two weeks foreign,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

2:52:21,on maybe we could we could actually do the things that you and the the general are concerned about but also continue,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:52:26,some of the other use and I think we have the language so new subsection D would read the city,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
2:52:33,at the mayor's discretion May Reserve not more than one residential dwelling unit owned or controlled by the city or,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:03:09,Steven will you brief us on the staff report sure so this application has to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:14,do with a new construction Hotel on Convention Center uh it's going to be a 173 unit hotel it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:23,is at the intersection of convention center and Calliope Convention Center is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:28,a street where you cannot establish a new curb cut uh except through the conditional use,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:34,process and so the uh curb cut is for a circular drop-off,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:39,there's no ability for Street drop off both streets down in the site I have no,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:45,parking Lane uh and certainly the hotel given its size has a need for loading and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:51,unloading activity uh as part of this the Planning Commission reached out to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:03:56,DPW as required is required by the zoning ordinance and asked if the curb cut could be located on Calliope Street,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:04:03,which is not a street that has restrictions on curb Cuts DPW responded,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:04:08,that due to the infrastructure and presence of a double sidewalk that that is not an appropriate location for a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:04:15,curb cut uh and with that in mind the Planning Commission supports the curb,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:04:21,cut on Calliope it's really the only place it can be located I will note that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:04:26,there is a requirement as a provisor that this be designed and essentially the most,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:04:31,uh the way that is most conducive to pedestrian activity the curb cut has to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:04:37,be as narrow as possible while also being able to receive a car uh and then,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:04:42,the sidewalk has to be patterned or textured in a way that uh it visually communicates that it's a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:04:48,pedestrian space and what that does is it it tells cars to slow down be aware of pedestrians and allows pedestrians to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:04:55,safely proceed through the sidewalk and so really this is a effort to balance both The Pedestrian needs along the site,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:05:01,with the hotels need to receive vehicles and with that uh consideration the Planning Commission recommends approval,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:05:08,thank you I know there was an initial issue with the report which Mr Burnside pointed out to my office and as Steven,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:05:14,said curb cuts are prohibited on Convention Center Boulevard unless DPW can provide proof that there is no other,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:05:20,option other than to have a curb cut on Convention Center Boulevard the evidence from DPW is not originally included in,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:05:26,the report but I've been able to review the Judgment made by DPW and I concur,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:05:31,with their judgment Mr Burnside I know you have a public comment followed by Mary Gilmore,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:05:45,well councilwoman it's finally nice to disagree with you I was beginning to wonder if I was just your twin brother,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:05:50,or something um I do disagree with you um but you have the power people elect,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:05:55,you they don't elect me partly because you're much Kinder than I am um I will say that if we're going to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:06:02,make a cut on Convention Center Boulevard uh which I don't agree with but if we are sort of two things remain,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:06:09,to be considered as we move forward one of which is the hotels uh are somewhat,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:06:15,like the city-owned buildings uh we don't,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:06:20,tie affordable housing into conditional uses and quite frankly we should,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:06:26,uh we are where we are because we've done what we've done if we keep doing what we've done we'll keep being where,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:06:31,we are so if we desire to be somewhere else maybe we need to do something else and uh you know poor people need access,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:06:39,to water and if the capitalistic Market is charging a hundred dollars a drink of water because you die without it that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:06:44,may make all the sense in the world from a capitalistic point of view but from a democratic government point of view it doesn't make any sense at all,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil

4:07:37,corner lot they cut one of each street instead of putting everything on one street I think the developer had options,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
4:07:43,and could have used them if he had been pressured to by the City by a little bit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQ8MxcIWQI&ab_channel=NewOrleansCityCouncil
