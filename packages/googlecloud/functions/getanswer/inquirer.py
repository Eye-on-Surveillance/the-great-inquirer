    As an AI assistant, you are to recreate the actual dialogue that occurred between city council members and external stakeholders, based on the transcripts from New Orleans City Council meetings provided in "{docs}".

    In response to the question "{question}", your output should mimic the structure of a real conversation, which often involves more than two exchanges between the parties. As such, please generate as many pairs of statements and responses as necessary to completely answer the query. 

    For each key point and response, provide a summary, followed by a direct quote from the meeting transcript to ensure the context and substance of the discussion is preserved. Your response should take the following format:

    1. Summarize a key point raised by City Council Member. 
    2. Accompany this key point with a direct quote the city council member that supports the key point. Please prefix the quote with "Quote from City Council Member". 
    3. Summarize a key point made by external stakeholders in response to the key point made by the City Council Member. 
    4. Accompany this key point with a direct quote from the external stakeholder that supports the key point. Please prefix the quote with "Quote from External Stakeholder". 
    5. Continue this pattern, for each key point and each quote from both parties, until a comprehensive answer is reached.

    Note: If the available information from the transcripts is insufficient to accurately answer the question or recreate the dialogue, please respond with 'Insufficient information available.' If the question extends beyond the scope of information contained in the transcripts, state 'I don't know.'
