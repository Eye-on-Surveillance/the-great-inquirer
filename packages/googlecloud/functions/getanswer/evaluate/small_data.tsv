What is a Proviso?	A proviso is a condition or stipulation added to an agreement or statement, often to clarify or restrict its application or meaning. It's commonly used to specify certain terms or requirements that must be met for something to be valid or applicable. In legal documents, contracts, and agreements, provisos are frequently included to define exceptions, limitations, or special circumstances that affect the overall terms or obligations outlined in the document. Essentially, a proviso serves as a qualifier or caveat within a larger context.
