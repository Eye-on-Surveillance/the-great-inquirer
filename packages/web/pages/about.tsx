      <p>
        Government surveillance, past and present, has been utilized to target
        black, brown, queer, and working communities in the interest of public
        safety. However, the fact remains that surveillance does not reduce
        crime and only further criminalizes those same communities. Eye on
        Surveillance is a group of community members and organizations working
        together under two points of unity:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
        <li>
          Halt the local governmentâ€™s expansion of surveillance tools such as
          facial recognition and increase oversight of current government
          surveillance methods.
        </li>
        <li>
          Work with communities who are targets of policing and surveillance to
          explore and implement evidence-based community safety options that
          dismantle systems of oppression.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
